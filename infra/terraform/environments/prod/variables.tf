    Whether Terraform declares the spec-095 MCP server Cloud Run service.

    on push to main with no human in the loop, and no pipeline in this repository publishes the
    `fairwins-mcp-server` image — so with this true, a promotion would attempt a Cloud Run create
    against an image that does not exist, fail, and (fail-fast + never-retry, FR-035) stop the
    estate's apply until somebody intervenes.

    Set it true only AFTER the image is published and verified present. Doing so is its own PR with
    its own reviewed plan — which is the point: review approves diffs, so the create must appear in
    one. See docs/runbooks/member-api-operations.md §3.8.

    ALREADY_EXISTS, but only after Terraform has begun working a graph that includes the network.
    A failed apply half-way through the estate is worse than one that never started.

    Adoption is by import, not by create — uncomment the `module.spa` group in imports.tf, bring the
    declaration to a ZERO-DIFF plan, and flip this in the same PR. Expect real reconciliation:
    Terraform owns Cloud Run SHAPE while Cloud Build owns the IMAGE (spec 087 rule 4), so the

    therefore SUCCEED and leave two of every alert policy — double paging, while the policies that
    actually fire stay unmanaged. A create that succeeds wrongly is harder to notice than one that
    fails, which is why this is gated rather than left to a careful reviewer.

    Adopt by importing each policy, uptime check and channel by id, then flip this.
