    Whether Terraform declares the spec-095 staging MCP server Cloud Run service.

    DEFAULT FALSE for the same reason as prod: `infra-apply.yml` applies on push to main with no
    human in the loop, and no pipeline publishes the `fairwins-mcp-server-staging` image, so a
    create here would fail against an image that does not exist. The apply matrix is fail-fast and
    is never retried unattended (FR-035).

    Flip it only after the image is published and verified present, in its own reviewed PR.
    See docs/runbooks/member-api-operations.md §3.8.

    Whether Terraform declares the two staging SPA Cloud Run services.

    DEFAULT FALSE. Both services are LIVE and NOT in state, and until this commit the declaration
    named them `staging` / `staging-testnet` while the live services are
    `prediction-dao-research-staging` / `-staging-testnet`. Because the module passes `name` through
    verbatim, that plan was not adopting anything — it was proposing two ADDITIONAL public services,
    and unlike a name collision it would have applied cleanly and left them running.

    The names are corrected and imports.tf now carries the real ids. Adopt by uncommenting that
    group, bringing it to a zero-diff plan, and flipping this in the same PR.
