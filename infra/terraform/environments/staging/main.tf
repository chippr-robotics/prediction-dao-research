/**
 * Staging environment (spec 087, and spec 076 FR-023/FR-026).
 *
 * TWO SERVICES FROM ONE COMMIT, and that is the design rather than an accident of convenience.
 * Vite folds VITE_NETWORK_ID into the bundle at build time, so ONE IMAGE RESOLVES EXACTLY ONE
 * cohort. Reaching every cohort therefore means two images and two services — not one service with
 * a runtime cohort switch, which would put a testnet/mainnet seam into code that also ships to
 * production and would make constitution III's boundary a runtime value instead of a build-time
 * fact.
 *
 *   staging          mainnet cohort (Polygon 137)  — the promotion mirror, what main will run next
 *   staging-testnet  testnet cohort (Amoy 80002)   — safe rehearsal, no real funds
 *
 * ⚠ THE MAINNET STAGING SERVICE TOUCHES REAL FUNDS. It has its own funded accounts, gas wallet,
 * paymaster deposit and origin-lock secret, and holds NO admin or deployer key — but the
 * transactions it sends are real.
 *
 * Staging has NO nodes, NO VPC and NO edge configuration: the long-running gasless nodes exist once,
 * in prod. State is a separate prefix, so a staging apply cannot reach prod state at all.

/**
 * MCP server, staging (spec 095).
 *
 * ⚠ OFF UNTIL THE IMAGE EXISTS — `manage_mcp_server` defaults to false and terraform.tfvars states
 * it. Nothing in this repository publishes `fairwins-mcp-server-staging` either:
 * cloudbuild.staging.yaml builds the two SPA cohort images and nothing else, and
 * container-build.yml's MCP job tags a local `:ci` image it never pushes. Ungated, a merge to main
 * would have this environment's unattended apply try to create a Cloud Run service from an image
 * that is not in the registry. See the module comment in environments/prod/main.tf for the full
 * reasoning and the ungate order.
 *
 * ONE SERVICE, NOT TWO, and the reason is the same reason the SPA needs two. The cohort split above
 * exists because Vite folds VITE_NETWORK_ID into the bundle: the cohort is a build-time fact there.
 * This service folds nothing — it reads its upstream from `FAIRWINS_API_URL` at runtime, and both
 * staging SPAs already point at the same relay host (cloudbuild.staging.yaml). A second copy would
 * be two identical services, which is a maintenance seam bought for no isolation.
 *
 * Stateless and secretless exactly as in prod: no `secret_env`, no runtime service account, and the
 * member's own capability token — never anything held here — is what authorizes a call. See the
 * comment on `module "mcp_server"` in environments/prod/main.tf for the full reasoning.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS POINTS AT THE MAINNET-COHORT STAGING RELAY, which touches real funds. It is a rehearsal of
 * the production wiring, not a sandbox.
