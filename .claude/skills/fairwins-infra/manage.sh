# FairWins gasless-infra control — bring the always-on Cloud Run services UP (warm)
# or DOWN (scale-to-zero) to control cost, and check status/health/config.
#
# Manages ONLY the two gasless-stack services (both run min=1 + cpu-throttling=false,
# i.e. a full vCPU allocated 24/7 — that is the cost we're toggling):
#   - fairwins-alto-bundler   (the ERC-4337 bundler)
#   - fairwins-relay-gateway  (the ERC-7677 paymaster + EIP-3009 relay signer)
#
# It NEVER touches the SPA (prediction-dao-research, already scales to zero) or any
# other project's services (clearpath-*, fukuii-*, kings-edge-*).
#
# "Down" sets min-instances=0: the service scales to zero and costs ~$0 when idle,
# but still cold-starts to serve an on-demand request. "Up" sets min-instances=1
# (warm) for active testing/use. Scaling changes do NOT alter env vars.
#
# Usage:
#   ./manage.sh status [bundler|gateway|all]     # default: all
#   ./manage.sh up      [bundler|gateway|all]     # warm (min=1) + health check
#   ./manage.sh down    [bundler|gateway|all]     # scale to zero (min=0)

# MIGRATED_TO_VM — the bundler no longer lives on Cloud Run.
#
# `manage.sh up` used to run --min-instances=1 on fairwins-alto-bundler. After the VM migration that
# starts a SECOND executor against alto-executor-key-137 (both ALTO_EXECUTOR_PRIVATE_KEYS and
# ALTO_UTILITY_PRIVATE_KEY resolve to that one secret), which collides nonces with the VM's alto and
# is invisible in-band — both instances look healthy. min-instances>0 starts an instance regardless
# of ingress, so --ingress=internal does NOT protect against this path.
#
# This is a hard refusal rather than a warning: the skill's own description tells the operator to run
# `up` before testing gasless transactions, so it is the lever most likely to be pulled by reflex.
#
# 2026-08-12: the GATEWAY has migrated too, and the guard had not followed it. Measured:
# `gcloud run services describe fairwins-relay-gateway` reports "Cannot find service" while
# `fairwins-gateway` (e2-small, us-central1-a) is RUNNING and serving relay.fairwins.app. `status`
# was therefore printing "DOWN (scale-to-zero)" for a service that does not exist, next to a health
# line that passes because it pings the public URL — so the output read as "the gateway is off and
# cheap" while a VM billed 24/7. A stale monitor that answers confidently is worse than one that
# errors, which is why both names are listed here now.

  Starting a Cloud Run instance alongside the VM runs a SECOND copy of this service against the same

  signal — both instances look healthy. Manage it on the VM instead:
    gcloud compute ssh $(vm_for "$1") --zone $VM_ZONE --tunnel-through-iap \\

  To genuinely roll back to Cloud Run, follow the rollback in docs/runbooks/vm-migration.md --
  it is a THREE-part action, and restoring the cloudbuild step is one of them.
