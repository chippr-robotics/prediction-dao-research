# ClearPath — Prediction DAO Research

Clear signals for collective decisions — ClearPath brings clarity to governance through futarchy-based decision-making, integrating privacy-preserving mechanisms from Nightmarket (zero-knowledge position encryption), anti-collusion infrastructure from MACI (encrypted key-change voting), and Gnosis Conditional Token Framework standards for market mechanics.

## 📚 Documentation

**[View the full ClearPath documentation →](https://chippr-robotics.github.io/prediction-dao-research/)**

The documentation site provides comprehensive guides for:
- **Users**: Getting started, trading on markets, submitting proposals
- **Developers**: Setup instructions, architecture, API reference
- **System Overview**: How it works, privacy mechanisms, security model

## Overview

This project implements a futarchy-based governance system where:
- **Democratic voting** establishes welfare metrics (protocol success measures)
- **Prediction markets** aggregate distributed knowledge about which proposals maximize those metrics
- **Privacy mechanisms** prevent collusion and vote buying
- **Conditional tokens** enable efficient market-based decision making

## System Components

### Smart Contracts

1. **FutarchyGovernor.sol** - Main governance coordinator
   - Integrates all futarchy components
   - Manages proposal lifecycle from submission to execution
   - Implements timelock and emergency pause mechanisms

2. **WelfareMetricRegistry.sol** - Welfare metrics management
   - On-chain storage of democratically-selected protocol success measures
   - Versioning and weight update mechanisms
   - Primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary metrics

3. **ProposalRegistry.sol** - Proposal submission and management
   - Permissionless proposal submission with bond requirements
   - Standardized metadata schemas
   - Milestone tracking and completion criteria

4. **ConditionalMarketFactory.sol** - Market deployment
   - Automated deployment of PASS/FAIL market pairs
   - Based on Gnosis Conditional Token Framework standards
   - LMSR (Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule) for market making

5. **PrivacyCoordinator.sol** - Privacy and anti-collusion
   - MACI-style encrypted message submission
   - Key-change capability to prevent vote buying
   - Nightmarket-style position encryption with zkSNARK proofs
   - Poseidon hash commitments for privacy

6. **OracleResolver.sol** - Multi-stage oracle resolution
   - Designated reporting phase
   - Open challenge period
   - UMA-style escalation mechanism
   - Bond-based dispute resolution

7. **RagequitModule.sol** - Minority protection
   - Moloch-style ragequit functionality
   - Allows dissenting token holders to exit with proportional treasury share
   - Prevents forced participation in controversial proposals

## Features

### Privacy Mechanisms
- **Zero-Knowledge Position Encryption**: Uses Poseidon encryption and Groth16 zkSNARKs for private trading
- **MACI Integration**: Key-change messages prevent verifiable vote buying
- **Batched Submissions**: Prevents timing analysis and correlation attacks

### Anti-Collusion
- **Encrypted Voting**: MACI-style encrypted key changes invalidate previous commitments
- **Position Privacy**: Nightmarket-style encryption hides individual positions
- **Non-Verifiable Commitments**: Participants can change keys to break collusion agreements

### Market Mechanics
- **Conditional Tokens**: Gnosis CTF-compatible PASS/FAIL tokens
- **LMSR Market Making**: Automated liquidity provision with bounded loss
- **Multiple Trading Periods**: 7-21 day configurable trading windows
- **Time-Weighted Pricing**: Reduces manipulation through TWAP oracles

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet

### Smart Contracts

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Compile contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

3. Run tests:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

4. Deploy to local network:
```bash
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### Frontend

1. Navigate to frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open browser to `http://localhost:5173`

## Usage

### For Proposers

1. **Connect Wallet**: Connect MetaMask or compatible wallet
2. **Submit Proposal**: 
   - Provide title, description, funding amount
   - Specify recipient address
   - Select welfare metric for evaluation
   - Pay 50 ETC bond (returned on good-faith resolution)
3. **Add Milestones**: Define completion criteria and timelock periods
4. **Monitor Status**: Track proposal through review → trading → resolution → execution

### For Traders

1. **Connect Wallet**: Connect to application
2. **Browse Markets**: View active prediction markets for proposals
3. **Trade Tokens**:
   - Buy PASS tokens if you believe proposal will increase welfare metrics
   - Buy FAIL tokens if you believe proposal will decrease welfare metrics
4. **Privacy Protection**: All positions encrypted with zero-knowledge proofs
5. **Settle Positions**: Redeem tokens after oracle resolution

### For Governance Participants

1. **Set Welfare Metrics**: Vote on which protocol success measures to use
2. **Challenge Oracle Reports**: Submit counter-evidence during challenge period
3. **Ragequit**: Exit with proportional treasury share if you disagree with proposal

## Technical Details

### Welfare Metrics

The system uses four types of welfare metrics:

1. **Treasury Value (Primary)**: TWAP of total treasury holdings in USD
2. **Network Activity (Secondary)**: Composite index of transactions and active addresses
3. **Hash Rate Security (Tertiary)**: Network hash rate relative to other PoW chains
4. **Developer Activity (Quaternary)**: GitHub commits, PRs, and contributors

### Security Features

- **Bond Requirements**: 50 ETC for proposals, 100 ETC for oracle reporting, 150 ETC for challenges
- **Timelock**: 2-day minimum before execution
- **Spending Limits**: 50k ETC max per proposal, 100k ETC daily aggregate
- **Emergency Pause**: Guardian multisig can pause in case of critical issues
- **Progressive Decentralization**: Guardian powers decrease on fixed schedule

### Privacy Architecture

- **Poseidon Encryption**: SNARK-friendly encryption for positions
- **ECDH Key Exchange**: Secure coordination between traders
- **Groth16 zkSNARKs**: Zero-knowledge proofs for validity
- **Batch Processing**: Positions revealed only after epoch confirmation
- **Key Changes**: MACI-style invalidation of previous commitments

**Quick Start:**
1. Set up Google Cloud project and enable required APIs
2. Configure GitHub repository secrets
3. Push changes to `main` or `develop` branch
4. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy the frontend

For local Docker testing:
```bash
cd frontend
docker build -t prediction-dao-frontend .
docker run -p 8080:8080 prediction-dao-frontend
```

### Mainnet Deployment

Before mainnet deployment:
1. Complete minimum 2 independent security audits
2. Publish audit reports
3. Run bug bounty program (100k USD equivalent in ETC)
4. 30-day community review period
5. Formal verification of critical invariants
