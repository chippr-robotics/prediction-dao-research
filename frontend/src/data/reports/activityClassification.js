/**
 * Reporting classification for the unified activity ledger
 * (spec 067 T107 — FR-035/FR-036/FR-039a; spec 051 contracts/ledger-entry.md).
 *
 * The report is the surface where a member's activity is read as money, so the
 * three judgements below have to be made once, here, rather than re-derived by
 * each renderer:
 *
 *   1. WHAT A BRIDGE IS. A bridge is ONE logical movement that happens to touch
 *      two networks and two transactions (FR-035). It is captured as a single
 *      ledger entry on the ORIGIN chain carrying the destination chain and both
 *      hashes; the destination side is never a second entry. `collapseLogical`
 *      guarantees that at the reporting boundary — independent of whichever
 *      store or source produced the entries — because the naive two-legged
 *      treatment of a cross-chain move either double-counts the value (two
 *      rows, one real movement) or nets it to zero by luck (an "out" on one
 *      chain cancelling an "in" on the other, which only works when both
 *      networks are in the same report, and this report is per-network).
 *
 *   2. WHAT A BRIDGE COSTS. Moving your own assets between networks is neither
 *      income nor a disposal (FR-036). The principal is therefore reported as
 *      value MOVED, kept out of the income/disposal split entirely, and the ONLY
 *      cost attributed to it is the platform fee actually charged.
 *
 *   3. WHICH "POOL" IS WHICH. `LEDGER_CLASS.POOL` is a *wager* pool (spec 034);
 *      `LEDGER_CLASS.LIQUIDITY` is an Earn → Supply position (spec 067). Both
 *      can appear in one report, so the bare word "Pool" is never a sufficient
 *      label (FR-039/FR-039a).
 *
 * A fee that was never reported is `unknown`, never `0`. "You were charged
 * nothing" and "we do not know what you were charged" are different claims and
 * a report may only make the one the data supports.
