/**
 * Custody activity source (spec 043, US6 / spec 031). Snapshot-diffs each vault the member belongs to on the
 * active network: a pending proposal that needs the member's approval (action: approve), a proposal newly
 * executed, and an owners/threshold governance change. Pure snapshot-diff (first-sight = baseline). No hooks;
 * read-only provider. No-ops until the SafeProposalHub is deployed + its block recorded (never scans genesis).
 *
 * Spec 049 (FR-016): the SafePolicyGuard's rule events (RulesConfigured, CooldownSet, AllowlistEnabled,
 * AllowlistChanged) join the same snapshot-diff — a per-vault event count is snapped, and any increase emits a
 * "policy-changed" entry in the custody domain. No-ops until the guard is deployed + its block recorded.
 *
 * CATCHING UP IS NOT FAILING. Both reads scan event history, and on a live network that history starts over a
 * million blocks back while the RPC caps one request at 10,000 blocks — so the first pass is a bounded,
 * resumable backfill (`lib/chain/logScan`) that spends CHUNK_BUDGET_PER_POLL requests per cycle and resumes on
 * the next. While it is still short of the chain head this source reports `partial`, NOT `ok:false`: the
 * distinction is the whole point, because `ok:false` is what raises the member-facing "couldn't refresh"
 * notice, and "still reading" is not "could not read". Nothing is diffed off an incomplete scan either — a
 * baseline taken half-way through would emit invented "a transaction was executed" entries as the scan caught
 * up with history the member has already seen.
