 * ledgerRepository — assembly of the unified activity ledger (spec 051).

 * Aggregates LedgerSource adapters (contracts/ledger-source.md) into one
 * normalized, deduplicated, enriched, sorted entry stream per (account,
 * chainId). Per-source degradation: a failing source marks its class stale
 * (`staleClasses`) instead of failing the ledger — the UI discloses staleness
 * honestly (constitution III) rather than blanking or fabricating.
 *
 * The read is two-state (`readState`): `unreadable` when every NETWORK-backed
 * source failed and nothing at all was collected, `read` otherwise. An
 * `unreadable` result's empty entry list is NOT an empty history — see #1280.
 * Sources declare `backing: 'network' | 'client'`; only network-backed ones
 * can testify that a chain went unread, because a client-store read fulfils
 * whether or not any network is up.
 *
 * Failed entries are INCLUDED here; excluding them from financial totals is
 * the summary helpers' job (FR-003), not the repository's.
