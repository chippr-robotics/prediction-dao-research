// collapsed to the single mini-app catalog entry, so ClearPath and Token Mint no longer
// appear in this menu; their `?tab=clearpath` / `?tab=tokens` deep links keep resolving to
// the host-native panels WalletPage still renders, unchanged. They become aliases to the
// mini-app routes — `tokens` → `/apps/token-mint` (T027) and `clearpath` → `/apps/clearpath`
// (T029) — only in the conversion tasks that actually publish those packages, and not
// before: an alias pointing at a mini-app nobody has registered turns a working deep link
// into a dead end, and the catalog would be claiming a verified package that does not exist.
// Wagers is NOT in that map and never will be — it did not become a package (see WAGERS_VIEW in
// config/appNav.js); it moved into Finance ▸ Transfer, and `/wagers` redirects there from App.jsx.

/**
 * AppNavDrawer — the global left navigation ("us"). On mobile it's a slide-over
 * drawer opened by the clover logo, exactly as before. On larger screens it's
 * always visible as a persistent icon-only gutter (no page content renders
 * under it — see the `.app-shell` padding in this file's CSS) that expands in
 * place to the full labelled panel; it never fully hides on desktop, so a
 * section is always one click away. Selecting an entry routes to the section
 * and returns to the gutter; the copyright footer only fits once expanded (the
 * legal/policy links that used to sit here moved to Settings → App, issue #1025).
 *
 * Spec 081 shapes the EXPANDED panel so its height is bounded by design: sections fold, pinned
 * apps are one capped strip rather than unbounded rows, a sticky field filters across the whole
 * menu, and a device preference tightens the rows. The collapsed desktop gutter is untouched by
 * all of it — 64px has no room for a heading, a field, or a strip, and every section's glyph
 * must stay reachable there.
 *
 * That field searches the APP, not the twelve words printed on the menu. It reads the nav search
 * index (config/navSearchIndex.js), which tags every section with the protocols and services it
 * holds and names the sub-surfaces inside it — so "morpho" finds Earn and offers Earn ▸ Lend,
 * "rpc" reaches Network even though Network is not in this menu, and "bip39" reaches the Legacy
 * account recovery card inside Recovery. Selecting one of those shortcuts navigates to its own
 * deep link carrying `focus=<id>`, and the surface it lands on flashes itself into view
 * (components/nav/AttentionFocus.jsx) so the member can see which thing they were looking for.
