/**
 * BridgeStatusList (spec 067, US1 — T081) — the member's cross-network transfers,
 * live ones first, each with BOTH transactions linked.
 *
 * This is the surface FR-009/FR-010/FR-011 are actually judged on, so three rules
 * shape every branch below:
 *
 *   1. Nothing is shown as complete before the DESTINATION network delivered.
 *      `bridgeLedgerSource` already refuses to persist `delivered` without a
 *      destination transaction hash and `deriveBridgeState` refuses to name it;
 *      `displayState()` applies the same test a third time at render, because a
 *      false "Delivered" is the worst thing this list can say. Same rule for
 *      `refunded`, which is equally a claim about money.
 *
 *   2. Nothing here holds the state. Entries are read back from the persisted
 *      client ledger and reconciled against evidence on mount, so a transfer
 *      started in another session shows its true current state (FR-010).
 *
 *   3. What is unknown says it is unknown. Each row carries an "as of" line
 *      naming where its status came from — the bridge service, the networks
 *      themselves, or neither — so a degraded read is visible rather than
 *      dressed up as progress (FR-052/FR-053/FR-054).
 *
 * Entries live on their ORIGIN chain (one per bridge, FR-035), so the list reads
 * every bridge-capable network rather than the wallet's active one: a member never
 * has to switch networks to see a transfer they started somewhere else (FR-059).
 *
 * Since #1265 that splits into TWO rosters, and keeping them apart is the point:
 *
 *   · what is READ over the network is `bridgeNetworks()`, bounded by the build's cohort,
 *     because constitution III forbids a read crossing the testnet/mainnet boundary;
 *   · what is LISTED is that roster PLUS every origin chain the member's own ledger
 *     actually has a bridge on (`listBridgeChainIds`), which is local storage and not a
 *     network read at all.
 *
 * Listing from the read roster alone would let a configuration change hide a transfer that
 * is already moving, which FR-053 forbids outright — the in-flight list renders underneath
 * the form in every case precisely so a member can always see where their money is. A row
 * whose origin chain is outside the read roster therefore renders with its recorded state
 * and says plainly that this build did not check it; that is rule 3 of this file doing its
 * job, and it is the opposite of an invented "no transfers yet".
