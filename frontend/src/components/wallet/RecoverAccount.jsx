/**
 * Recovery by address (spec 104, US3).
 *
 * Reached when a passkey ceremony succeeded but the app could not confirm which account the key
 * controls. The member names their account; the CHAIN decides whether they get in.
 *
 * Two things about this screen are load-bearing.
 *
 * The address is a HINT, never a claim. It goes through exactly the same on-chain confirmation a
 * searched candidate takes — the connector re-runs the ceremony and verifies the key against that
 * account's current owner set — which is what stops "type any address" from being a way into
 * somebody else's account. Nothing here is trusted; this form only supplies a place to look.
 *
 * And the three verdicts stay three. `unverified` (we could not reach the network) must never be
 * rendered as `none-found` (there is nothing there): they are reached by different causes and lead
 * to different actions — retry versus recover — and telling a member with a perfectly good account
 * that they have none is the identity equivalent of rendering an unreadable balance as $0.
