/**
 * BridgeView (spec 067, US1 — T078/T080/T083/T151) — the Transfer → Bridge surface.
 *
 * A member picks an asset they hold on ANY supported network, a destination network, and
 * an amount; reads one itemized quote (BridgeQuoteCard); and confirms from their own
 * wallet. Nothing here takes custody and nothing here claims delivery — the progress view
 * (BridgeStatusList) owns what happens after the signature, and only destination-chain
 * evidence can complete a transfer (FR-009).
 *
 * ── THE INVERSION (research R11b) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The destination selector uses `bridgeDest` — the SAME asset on OTHER networks (FR-063).
 * It must NEVER use `samePair`, the pair/swap rule (FR-062). Getting this backwards fails
 * silently and expensively: the destination would sit on the source chain, the gateway
 * would still price it, the member would still sign, and a "bridge" would have become an
 * ordinary same-chain transfer with a bridge's fees. `frontend/src/test/bridge/
 * BridgeView.test.jsx` fails if the predicate is swapped — keep that test.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ── THE SIGNING-TIME SWITCH (FR-061, T151) ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * The selector deliberately lists assets on networks the wallet is NOT currently on, so
 * the switch has to happen somewhere. It happens at SUBMIT, through `useEarnSend`, and is
 * disclosed above the confirm button before any signature. A member never has to find a
 * network switcher to start; without this the cross-network list would produce a failed
 * transaction for every asset off the active chain.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Honest states (FR-051/FR-052/FR-053/FR-054/FR-006c, T083). Availability is READ, never
 * assumed: the gateway prices transfers (no gateway ⇒ no bridge, research R10) and the
 * on-chain `BridgeRouter` is the authority on routes, limits, and the pause flag. An
 * undeployed or unreadable router withholds the surface with a stated reason rather than
 * offering controls that cannot work, and the route list is shown "as of" its last read.
 * Bitcoin is out of scope (FR-006) and says so — its network ids are STRINGS and are kept
 * away from every chain-keyed call by `isEvmOption`.
 *
 * ── ONE ROSTER (issue #1265) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The asset selector draws on the CATALOG (`useSelectableAssets({catalog:true})`), which is
 * mainnets-always plus a member opt-in and knows nothing about the build's cohort. This form
 * narrows it to `bridgeNetworks()` — the same cohort-bounded roster the availability copy and
 * `BridgeStatusList` read — because those three must describe ONE build. Before #1265 they did
 * not have to: the roster spanned both cohorts, so it was never empty. Bounding only the copy
 * would have let a testnet build quote, sign and record a mainnet bridge and then state
 * underneath that no network here bridges at all — a transfer the member had just made,
 * denied by the surface that made it (FR-053). Networks dropped by this narrowing are NAMED
 * with their real reason below (FR-006c); a silent omission is the failure that requirement
 * exists to prevent.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ── SCREENING AND THE RESTRICTED ACCOUNT (FR-032/FR-033, T116/T154) ──────────────────
 * The acting wallet is screened through `useAddressScreening` — the platform's one
 * screening path — against the SOURCE network (its own read provider, because the wallet
 * may still be on another chain until the signing-time switch). The verdict does two
 * different jobs, and conflating them would be the failure:
 *   · at DISPLAY it disables the confirm control and states the reason;
 *   · at SUBMISSION it is read AGAIN, forced past the cache, so a wallet deny-listed
 *     between the quote and the signature is still refused before anything is signed.
 * A restricted member is refused new value-in ONLY. Everything already sent stays visible
 * and keeps settling — the progress list is a sibling of this form and is never gated —
 * because refusing new money is correct and trapping existing money is not.
 * `uncertain` is not `restricted`: the guard is not deployed on every bridgeable network,
 * so an unscreenable wallet is disclosed, never blocked on an assumption.
