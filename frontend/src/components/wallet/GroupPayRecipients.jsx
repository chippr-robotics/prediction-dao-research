/**
 * GroupPayRecipients (release 1.14.0) — rows 2..N of a group payment, shared by Home ▸ Pay and
 * Transfer ▸ Send.
 *
 * The list is deliberately ADDITIVE: row 1 stays the form's own To/amount fields, untouched, and
 * this component only exists once a member presses "Add another recipient". A member sending to
 * one person therefore sees, and signs, exactly what they did before — one new button is the
 * entire difference.
 *
 * Address entry is the platform's ordinary `AddressInput`, so every row keeps the spec-054
 * resolution priority (address book > callsign > ENS > raw) and the address book picker. A row
 * carries BOTH what was typed (`raw`, so an ENS name stays visible) and what it resolved to
 * (`address`, which is what gets paid) — never one standing in for the other.
 *
 * ISSUE #1441 — `available` withdraws the whole thing. When it is false this renders NOTHING, and
 * it first empties any list that already exists: rows left in the parent's state while the control
 * is gone would still be submitted, which is the one way hiding a control can be worse than
 * leaving it. Availability is `groupPayAvailability` (see `lib/payments/groupPay.js`), so today it
 * is false everywhere; the prop defaults to true so the component's own tests still drive the list
 * that #1538 turns back on.
