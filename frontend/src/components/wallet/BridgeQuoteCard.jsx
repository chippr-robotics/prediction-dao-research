/**
 * BridgeQuoteCard (spec 067, US1 — T079/T080) — the single honest quote a member reads
 * before signing a bridge.
 *
 * Purely presentational, in the register of the Earn/Stake fact lists: it renders the
 * `BridgeQuote` built by `lib/bridge/acrossQuotes.js` and derives nothing. Every figure
 * shown here came from Across or from the fee split — this component never adds, infers,
 * or rounds a cost into existence.
 *
 * The rules it exists to keep:
 *   - FR-007: the amount that will ARRIVE, then every cost on its OWN labelled line with
 *     an InfoTip, then the total, then an arrival estimate. A line whose figure the
 *     upstream did not give us reads "Not available" — never 0.00 (a fabricated zero is
 *     the exact dishonesty this feature must not ship).
 *   - FR-008: the quote's validity window is visible, and once it elapses the card says
 *     so and offers a refresh. The confirm control is the CALLER's, gated on the same
 *     `stale` flag it passes in, so there is one source of truth for staleness.
 *   - FR-012: a destination network the member has no gas coin on is disclosed here,
 *     before signature, and ONLY when the balance was actually read as zero
 *     (`destinationGasWarning === true`). Unknown stays silent rather than warning about
 *     a state we did not observe. v1's route cannot deliver destination gas as part of
 *     the transfer — `bridgeWithFee` takes no such parameter — so there is no option to
 *     present, and the copy says what the member must do instead.
 *   - FR-014: Across is named on the quote itself, not only in the small print.
