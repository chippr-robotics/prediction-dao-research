/**
 * SupplySheet (spec 067, US2 — T095/T096/T097/T099/T103/T153) — supply to, add to, and
 * withdraw from ONE curated liquidity pool. Bottom sheet reusing the shared
 * `.asset-sheet-*` shell, in the same idiom as `VaultSheet` and `StakeSheet`.
 *
 * Writes go through `useEarnSend` → `WalletContext.sendCalls` (the unified spec-041 rail), so
 * a passkey session authorizes the whole approve+supply batch with one ceremony and a classic
 * wallet signs each step.
 *
 * ── FIVE THINGS THIS FILE EXISTS TO KEEP TRUE ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. THE FEE IS CHARGED ON CAPITAL ACTUALLY DEPLOYED, NOT ON WHAT THE MEMBER OFFERS.
 *    `LiquidityRouter._supply` quotes the fee AFTER the mint against the amounts Uniswap
 *    actually consumed; everything the pool did not take is refunded whole, with no fee on it.
 *    So the confirm step discloses the RATE and what it applies to, plus an explicit CEILING
 *    ("if the pool takes everything you entered…"). It never renders "fee = rate × amount you
 *    typed" as though that were the charge — that figure is too high whenever the pool's price
 *    ratio takes less than both legs, and promising it would be dishonest (FR-028).
 *
 * 2. BRIDGE-LP IS FEE-FREE AND DOES NOT GO THROUGH THE ROUTER. Across's `addLiquidity` has no
 *    recipient parameter, so routing it would make FairWins the owner of a position the member
 *    could never exit (research R3). Those deposits are a DIRECT member call to the HubPool,
 *    and they show NO fee line at all — not a line reading 0.00, which would imply a lever
 *    that does not exist. `liquidityFeeCopy` returns null for them, always, and this sheet
 *    never fetches a fee quote on that path.
 *
 * 3. THE PAIR SELECTOR USES `samePair`, NOT `bridgeDest` — the exact inverse of the Bridge
 *    surface. A Uniswap pair lives on ONE network (FR-062). Swapping the predicate fails
 *    silently: an impossible cross-network "pair" would assemble and reach the confirm step.
 *    `src/test/earn/SupplySheet.test.jsx` fails if it is swapped — keep that test.
 *
 * 4. THE SHEET IS NOT GATED ON THE WALLET'S ACTIVE CHAIN. Availability is per-POOL, and the
 *    network switch happens at SIGNING, disclosed before the signature (FR-059/FR-061, T153).
 *    A member holding assets on another network is never told to go and switch first.
 *
 * 5. WITHDRAWAL IS NEVER FEE-GATED AND ALWAYS WORKS. It carries no platform fee (FR-021/
 *    FR-030), it is unaffected by an unreadable fee rate, and it works on a RETIRED pool —
 *    retirement closes new deposits only, and the pool stays visible and withdrawable
 *    (FR-024). Where inventory cannot fill an exit in full, the member takes what is available
 *    now and is told plainly that the remainder can be withdrawn later (FR-022).
 *
 * 6. SCREENING REFUSES VALUE-IN ONLY, AND IT BITES AT SUBMISSION (FR-032/FR-033, T116/T154).
 *    The acting wallet is screened through `useAddressScreening` — the platform's one
 *    screening path — against the POOL's network, using that network's own read provider,
 *    because the wallet may still be on another chain until the signing-time switch. The
 *    verdict is read TWICE and for two different jobs: at display it holds back the step that
 *    leads to a signature, and inside `submitSupply` it is re-read PAST THE CACHE so a wallet
 *    deny-listed since the sheet opened is refused before anything is signed. It never touches
 *    `submitWithdraw`: a restricted member keeps the exit, in full, always — point 5 is not
 *    conditional on screening. Note the BRIDGE-LP supply is a direct HubPool call with no
 *    FairWins contract in it, so this client-side screen is the only screen on that path.
 *    A verdict of `uncertain` blocks nothing AND says nothing: the pools here are a CURATED
 *    list of protocol contracts, not counterparties a member picks, so "we could not screen
 *    this network" is not a fact about the deposit in front of them. It used to be shown, and
 *    it read as a warning about a swap that carries no counterparty risk to warn about. What
 *    is NOT conditional is the refusal — a listed wallet is still refused, at display and
 *    again past the cache at submission.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ── PROPS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   pool           the pool this sheet opened for (required). Shape = `normalizePool` output
 *                  (`poolId, kind, enabled, feeTier, token0, token1, poolAddress,
 *                  maxDeposit0PerTx, maxDeposit1PerTx`) enriched for display with:
 *                  `chainId, networkName, token0Meta:{symbol,decimals}, token1Meta,
 *                  routerAddress, positionManager` (trading) / `hubPool, lpToken` (bridge),
 *                  and optional `unreachable: true` when the protocol could not be read.
 *   pools          every curated pool the member may supply, across networks. Used ONLY to
 *                  decide which assets can be a pair leg and which counterpart forms a real
 *                  curated pool — the selector never invents a pair (FR-054).
 *   assetOptions   `useSelectableAssets` options across ALL supported networks (spec 064).
 *   positions      the member's open positions, matched to a pool by `poolId`.
 *   onClose / onActionComplete
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
