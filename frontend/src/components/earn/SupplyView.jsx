/**
 * SupplyView (spec 067, US2 — T093/T098/T100/T101) — the Earn → Supply area.
 *
 * ONE curated list holding BOTH kinds of pool together (FR-015): trading
 * liquidity (an asset PAIR supplied to Uniswap) and bridge liquidity (a SINGLE
 * asset supplied to Across's HubPool), each labelled, each carrying the shared
 * nested asset + network artwork, laid out like the Lend vault list so the two
 * areas read as one experience.
 *
 * ── FIVE THINGS THIS FILE IS DELIBERATE ABOUT ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. THE AREA IS NOT GATED ON THE WALLET'S ACTIVE CHAIN. Availability is per
 *    POOL, not per active network, and the network switch happens at SIGNING
 *    (FR-059/FR-061). Phase 3 shipped that gate on the Bridge tab by accident
 *    and the audit caught it: a member holding assets on one network was shown
 *    an instruction they could not follow. What the active network gets here is
 *    a NOTE — one that says in as many words that you do not have to switch to
 *    look around — never a wall in front of the list.
 *
 * 2. AVAILABILITY IS ASYMMETRIC AND THE COPY SAYS SO. Trading liquidity is on
 *    every supported Uniswap network; bridge liquidity is ETHEREUM ONLY,
 *    because the Across HubPool is an L1 contract by design (research R8).
 *    `liquidityAvailabilityCopy()` states both halves separately so nothing here
 *    implies both kinds exist everywhere.
 *
 * 3. A RETIRED POOL STAYS VISIBLE AND WITHDRAWABLE (FR-024). It is filtered out
 *    of nothing. `tokenFilter` narrows by asset, never by state, and a pool a
 *    member holds is rendered whatever the router says about new deposits — a
 *    pool is never hidden while someone's money is inside it.
 *
 * 4. EVERY POSITION FIGURE IS LABELLED AN ESTIMATE (FR-020). Current value,
 *    earnings to date, and — for trading pools — the current composition all
 *    move with the market. They are read from the protocol and shown as "—"
 *    with a reason when they cannot be read, never filled in.
 *
 * 5. THE FEE IS CHARGED ON CAPITAL ACTUALLY DEPLOYED. Nothing on this surface
 *    promises a fee AMOUNT: `LiquidityRouter._supply` quotes the fee after the
 *    mint against what Uniswap actually consumed, and refunds the remainder
 *    whole. Cards disclose the RATE (see LiquidityPoolCard); bridge pools show
 *    no fee line at all, because that path cannot be charged without taking
 *    custody (research R3).
 *
 * DATA. `useLiquidityCatalog` reads the on-chain control surface directly — the
 * per-network `LiquidityRouter` is the authority on which pools are curated and
 * whether supplying is open (FR-051) — and returns null-on-failure everywhere,
 * so an unreadable protocol degrades into a stated reason instead of invented
 * figures (FR-054). The `catalog` prop is the injection seam: pass one and the
 * hook stands down. That is what the tests use, and what a future shared hook
 * would use.
