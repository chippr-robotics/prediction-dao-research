/**
 * useAdminTx (spec 093) — the shared admin write runner, extracted verbatim
 * from the monolithic AdminPanel's `runTx`.
 *
 * RESOLVES `true` on success and `false` on any failure — including a rejected
 * wallet prompt — never `undefined` and never a rejection. Callers that send a
 * SEQUENCE need that: the spec-067 bulk route toggles promised "a failed or
 * rejected signature stops the rest", and with a signal-free result the loop
 * could not observe a revert, so rejecting the first prompt still queued the
 * remaining four.
 *
 * `onSuccess` replaces the monolith's hard-wired `fetchContractState()`:
 * each app passes its own refresh so a write refreshes the state it changed.
 *
 * `errorAbi` is per CALL, not per hook (issue #1267). One `runTx` is shared by
 * apps that write to DIFFERENT contracts — Compliance drives both the deny list
 * and the mini-app registry through this hook — so an ABI fixed at the hook
 * would decode one contract's revert with another's fragments and could name
 * the wrong error on a selector collision. The caller that knows which contract
 * it is writing to is the one that supplies the fragments.

 * arrives as raw `error.data` that ethers never lifts into `.revert`: `shortMessage` is then the
 * useless "execution reverted (unknown custom error)" even though the caller's own ABI names it.
