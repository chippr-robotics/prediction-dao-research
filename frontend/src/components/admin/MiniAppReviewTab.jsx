/**
 * MiniAppReviewTab (spec 073 T038, US4 · FR-004, FR-004a, FR-004b, FR-022) — the curator's
 * review queue for the on-chain mini-app registry.
 *
 * This is the surface where a human decides which third-party code a member's browser is
 * allowed to execute. Four rules shape every line of it, and each is a hole if reversed.
 *
 * **1. A DECISION NAMES THE BYTES THAT WERE REVIEWED (FR-004a).** `approveApp` and
 * `rejectProposal` are content-committed: they carry the `manifestHash` the curator saw, and
 * the chain reverts `StaleProposal` if the record no longer holds it. That guard only works
 * if the hash this UI submits is the hash it DISPLAYED, so the tuple is captured from the
 * rendered record and passed through unmodified. A vendor can otherwise swap the package while
 * a multisig collects signatures — or simply front-run the approving transaction — and have
 * unreviewed code marked Approved. `StaleProposal` is consequently a FIRST-CLASS outcome here,
 * not an error toast: it means "the vendor changed the package", so the record is refreshed,
 * the stale verification is discarded, and the curator must re-review before the control comes
 * back.
 *
 * **2. VERIFICATION HAPPENS BEFORE APPROVAL, AND IT NEVER EXECUTES THE PACKAGE (FR-022).**
 * `verifyMiniAppPackage` runs the launch path's own fetch → keccak(manifest) → parse →
 * per-file sha-256 chain (it is literally the same function, minus the final Blob `import()`),
 * so "verified" here means the same thing the host will mean at launch. Approving bytes nobody
 * could verify is the failure mode this platform exists to prevent, so a proven hash mismatch
 * BLOCKS approval outright — that tuple could never launch — and any other failure requires an
 * explicit, recorded acknowledgement.
 *
 * **3. AUTHORITY COMES FROM THE REGISTRY, NOT FROM BEING AN ADMIN.** `APP_CURATOR_ROLE`
 * administers itself on-chain precisely so a platform administrator cannot grant it. Controls
 * are therefore offered only on a definite `hasRole` yes (`registryAuthority.js`), and the
 * three ways of not getting them — no account, an unread registry, a definite no — say which
 * one happened. An unread registry must never render as "you are not a curator": that sends a
 * curator hunting for a permissions problem that does not exist.
 *
 * **4. STATUS IS NOT THE SERVING DECISION.** `status` is the REVIEW state; `launchable` is the
 * chain's answer to "may a host run this?". A Pending record CAN be launchable — a live app
 * with an update in review, still serving its last reviewed package (FR-003) — so both are
 * displayed, separately and labelled, and neither is derived from the other. A reviewer
 * suspending an app needs to know it is live right now; a reviewer approving one needs to know
 * what is live versus what is being asked for.
 *
 * The registry lives on ONE chain (`miniAppChainId()`, FR-025), so there is no network picker:
 * reads always go to that chain, and a write requires the wallet to be there — re-checked at
 * submit time, not only in the disabled attribute, because a wallet that switched networks
 * between render and click would otherwise sign against a registry the curator was not looking
 * at.
