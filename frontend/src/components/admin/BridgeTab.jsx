/**
 * BridgeTab (spec 067, US4) — the operator control surface for cross-chain bridging.
 *
 * One screen per network for the on-chain `BridgeRouter`:
 *   - Status + emergency pause / resume of new bridges — GUARDIAN_ROLE (FR-043/FR-044).
 *   - Curated routes: add, edit, enable, disable, remove, per-transaction limits, and bulk
 *     enable/disable per destination — LIQUIDITY_ADMIN_ROLE (FR-041/FR-045, SC-017).
 *   - Protocol addresses (Across SpokePool, FeeRouter, sanctions guard) with the current value
 *     beside the input and invalid input refused with a reason BEFORE the wallet prompt (FR-042).
 *   - The `bridge.transfer` platform fee — READ-ONLY here; rates live on the FeeRouter and are
 *     edited in the Fees tab by a FEE_ADMIN (spec 060, FR-048).
 *   - Operations: what is in flight, what is past its expected window, what recently delivered
 *     or came back, and whether the quoting gateway is up (FR-047).
 *   - Decoded on-chain change history — the audit trail (FR-046).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TWO THINGS THIS TAB MUST NOT IMPLY.
 *
 * 1. **Scope is a NETWORK, not the connected wallet.** Bridge control state exists on five
 *    networks at once (FR-050). Reads here span all of them from each network's own RPC; only
 *    WRITES need the wallet on the selected network, and the tab says so rather than showing a
 *    dead button. An operator must never conclude "no routes are configured" from being
 *    connected somewhere else.
 *
 * 2. **The Operations panel is OBSERVATIONAL ONLY.** There is no operator action — here or in
 *    the contract — that can touch a member's in-flight bridge. Across settles directly to the
 *    member and the router is not in that path, which is exactly why `IBridgeRouter` has no
 *    rescue or claim-refund function. Pausing stops NEW bridges; it cannot reach one already
 *    moving, and it cannot strand one either. The panel states this so nobody spends an incident
 *    hunting for a button that was deliberately never built.
