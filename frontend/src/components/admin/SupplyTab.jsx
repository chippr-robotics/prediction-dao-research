/**
 * SupplyTab (spec 067, US4) — the operator control surface for supplied liquidity.
 *
 * One screen per network for the on-chain `LiquidityRouter`:
 *   - Status + pause / resume — GUARDIAN_ROLE (FR-043/FR-044).
 *   - The curated pool list of BOTH kinds, with per-transaction caps, supplied totals and
 *     position counts — LIQUIDITY_ADMIN_ROLE (FR-041/FR-045/FR-048).
 *   - Protocol addresses (Uniswap position manager, FeeRouter, sanctions guard), current value
 *     beside the input, invalid input refused with a reason before the wallet prompt (FR-042).
 *   - The `liquidity.deposit` platform fee — READ-ONLY (spec 060 single source of truth).
 *   - Decoded on-chain change history (FR-046).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE TWO THINGS THIS TAB EXISTS TO SAY OUT LOUD (research R3, FR-024).
 *
 * 1. **The pause is NARROW: it pauses new UNISWAP supplies, and nothing else.** Bridge-pool
 *    deposits are a DIRECT member call to Across's HubPool — `addLiquidity` has no recipient
 *    parameter, so routing them would leave FairWins owning a position the member could never
 *    exit. No FairWins contract is in that path, so no FairWins contract can stop it. What
 *    withholds a bridge pool is the per-pool `enabled` flag, which the app honours. Every label
 *    here says "new Uniswap supplies" rather than "pooling", because an operator reaching for a
 *    killswitch during an incident must not walk away believing they stopped something they did
 *    not.
 *
 * 2. **A retired pool is RETIRED, not GONE.** `setPoolEnabled(false)` closes a pool to NEW
 *    deposits and nothing else — which is why the contract has no `removePool` at all. Members
 *    still hold positions there and must keep being able to see and exit them, so retired pools
 *    stay in this table, with their position count, rather than disappearing from it.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * As on the Bridge tab, scope is a NETWORK and not the connected wallet: reads span every
 * Uniswap-capable network from its own RPC, and only writes need the wallet there (FR-050).

  // an instantly-resolved mock: `paused()` was called 51 times in 250ms, 201 in 1s and 401 in 2s —
  // linear in how long an operator leaves the tab open, each lap carrying the batched address reads,

  // a reference to a row — a click landing mid-lap, or a test that queried an element and acted on
  // it a tick later — was holding a detached node.
  //
  // The fee quote genuinely SHOULD re-run when the router's FeeRouter changes. Only the coupling

              A <strong>bridge pool’s</strong> per-transaction cap is enforced by this app, not by the
              router: the contract’s limit check sits inside the Uniswap supply path, and a bridge-LP
              deposit is a direct member call to Across that never enters it. The cap still does real
              work — every FairWins surface refuses above it — but a member calling the HubPool
              directly is not bound by it, exactly as with the <em>enabled</em> flag.
