/**
 * The two perps fee rails as DATA and DECISIONS (spec 083 US5, contracts/fee-rails.md).
 *
 * Split out of `PerpsFeesPanel.jsx` for the same reason `positionSheetActions.js` was split out of
 * the position sheet: the rendering is the least interesting part. What matters here is which
 * contract each rail is read from, and the one guard standing between an administrator and a
 * transaction that would re-point revenue at their own wallet. Those are worth asserting directly,
 * not only through a DOM.
 *
 *   GMX v2       authority is GMX's OWN `DataStore` on Arbitrum. There is deliberately no
 *                `perps.gmx.uifee` FeeRouter service: it would be a second config store for a rate
 *                FairWins cannot enforce, and its admin control would silently do nothing.
 *   Hyperliquid  authority is the FairWins `FeeRouter` service `perps.hyperliquid.builder`. It is
 *                READ here and EDITED in the Fees tab — one value, one control.
 *   Gains        a venue-paid rebate. No authority, no rate, and therefore no function here.
 *
 * Every read returns a three-state `chainReadResult` (read / not-deployed / unreadable). On a fee
 * schedule a silent 0 is read as "we charge nothing", so an unreachable chain must never produce
 * one — which is why there is no code path in this module that turns a failure into a number.
