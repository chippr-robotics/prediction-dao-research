/**
 * Membership & Revenue admin mini-app (spec 093) — the monolithic AdminPanel's
 * `tiers`, `members` and `treasury` views extracted verbatim, plus the
 * re-hosted FeesTab and PerpsFeesPanel.
 *
 * ── MEMBERSHIP ADMIN IS PINNED TO THE REFERENCE CHAIN, NOT SCOPED (spec 071
 * FR-003/FR-006) ── Tiers and Members are the one place a scope PICKER would
 * be wrong. Membership is read from exactly one chain, so a tier ladder
 * configured anywhere else is one no purchase consults, and a membership
 * granted anywhere else is one the app never sees. Same rule as purchases:
 * one home, named, with the wallet required to be there.
 *
 * The dashboard is the monolith Overview's membership/treasury content in its
 * new home: MembershipTreasuryOverview (stats, revenue sparkline, breakdown
 * bars) and the two estate fee tables — accrued (undrawn) and treasury
 * (received), never combined (spec 071 FR-021…FR-023).
