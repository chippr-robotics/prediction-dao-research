// Spec 043 — Custody surface. Lives under Tools → Protect with two sub-sections: "On chain"
// (Safe multisig) and "Off chain" (reserved, disabled). Gated by Safe availability: on a network without a
// configured Safe deployment, vault CREATION shows an honest "unavailable on this network" state (FR-030).
//
// Spec 068 (US1) — the vault LIST is no longer gated by the connected chain: a member's vaults on
// every chain are always listed with their chain identity (FR-003), and only creation/load are
// restricted to networks where custody is deployed (FR-005). Actions on a vault whose chain is not
// the connected one are withheld behind a switch prompt (FR-004).
//
// Spec 102 — ONE card per vault ADDRESS (VaultCardList over `groups`), and every per-vault action
// behind the VaultSheet (Queue / Style / Details). `?vault=<address>` deep-links to a vault's sheet
// (FR-017) — address only, never a chain; the param is removed again when the sheet closes.
