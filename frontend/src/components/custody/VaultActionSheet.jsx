/**
 * VaultActionSheet (release 1.14.0) — the four things a member does with a multisig vault, behind
 * one bottom sheet instead of scattered across the Protect card.
 *
 *   Create vault          → CreateVaultWizard   (spec 043/049/068)
 *   Load a vault          → LoadVaultForm       (spec 068 cross-chain search)
 *   Propose a transaction → ProposeTransactionForm (spec 043 US2 / 049 FR-012 pre-flight)
 *   Approve or execute    → VaultProposalsPanel (spec 043 US2 queue + governance)
 *
 * It re-implements NONE of them: every view mounts the component that already owns that flow, with
 * the same callbacks CustodyPanel passed inline before. What the sheet adds is a single door and an
 * honest closed one — an action a member cannot take right now is offered DISABLED with the reason
 * stated, never hidden (a missing control reads as a broken app) and never live-but-failing.
 *
 * Multi-chain rules (spec 068) hold inside the sheet exactly as they do outside it: a vault carries
 * its own `chainId`, and `propose` re-checks the wallet's chain at SUBMIT time — the wallet can
 * switch networks while this sheet is open, and a custody action must never be submitted to a chain
 * other than the vault's own. (The approve/execute view delegates to VaultProposalsPanel, which
 * carries that same check for its own actions.)
