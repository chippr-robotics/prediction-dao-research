// Spec 043 (US1) — load an existing vault by address. Distinguishes "not a contract", "not a Safe", and a
// real Safe (owned vs view-only is derived after load). Delegates the chain read to onLoad.
//
// Spec 068 (US5) — address entry goes through the shared Protect field (paste, address book, QR).
// Spec 068 also makes loading CROSS-CHAIN: `onLoad` searches every custody network, so a member
// pasting a vault address does not have to already know which chain it is on.
//
// Spec 102 (US2, FR-003) — every network the address is a Safe on is ADDED, and the result says so
// ("Found on Polygon, Base and Optimism"). The "pick another network" prompt is gone: it asked a
// question the member cannot answer yet. Networks that could not be reached are NAMED and can be
// checked again; nothing is added for them. The form closes as soon as at least one network was
// added, and stays open only when nothing was.
