/**
 * The OpenPositionSheet's venue work (spec 083, T050) — the ENTRY-path twin of
 * `positionSheetActions.js`.
 *
 * Its own module for the same two reasons that one is: `OpenPositionSheet.jsx` may only export
 * components (`react-refresh/only-export-components`), and the parts worth testing directly are
 * exactly the parts that decide what calldata a member signs — the ownership field this never
 * touches, the venue handle it refuses to guess, and the refusals it produces BEFORE a wallet
 * prompt.
 *
 * THIS MODULE IS ON THE ENTRY PATH, which is what makes it different from every other module in
 * `components/perps/`. Opening is the ONE action FairWins gates (FR-014/FR-015), so this file is
 * allowed to name the attestation and the screening client, and it is classified as ENTRY in
 * `test/perps/safetyInvariants.test.js`. Nothing here may ever be imported by an exit-path module;
 * that suite fails the build if one does.
 *
 * FOUR RULES, each of which is a specific harm when broken:
 *
 * 1. **THE MEMBER IS ALWAYS `msg.sender`.** Neither `buildOpenDescriptor` nor anything it returns
 *    carries a `trader` / `account` field: the hook supplies the member's own address to the venue
 *    builders, and those overwrite-and-check it (`gains.buildOpenTradeCall` refuses an open owned
 *    by the FairWins referrer address). The only FairWins address that leaves here is
 *    `uiFeeReceiver`, and it travels as its own named GMX parameter. **No Gains referrer is sent
 *    at all** — the venue has not whitelisted FairWins, so an address there would earn nothing and
 *    would put a FairWins address one field away from `Trade.user`.
 *
 * 2. **A VENUE HANDLE IS NEVER GUESSED.** Gains needs its own `pairIndex` and 1-based
 *    `collateralIndex`; GMX needs the market token. Where the feed did not supply one, this refuses
 *    with the venue named — it does not fall back to "the first BTC market", because a wrong market
 *    on a leveraged position is worse than no position (`lib/perps/gmxMarkets.js`, same rule).
 *
 * 3. **HONEST NUMBERS.** Every preview figure is an ESTIMATE derived from figures the venue
 *    published, and anything that cannot be derived is `null` for the caller to render '—'. The
 *    liquidation estimate deliberately ignores fees and funding and says so: a number that looks
 *    exact and is not is worse than one labelled approximate.
 *
 * 4. **REFUSE, DO NOT THROW.** Every export runs from a render or a click handler. Junk in yields
 *    `{ ok: false, reason }` with a member-facing sentence, never an exception in front of someone
 *    about to commit money.

 *    different position, on a different network, than the row they tapped. The pairs table already
 *    renders the venue+chain badge per row, so the member picks the chain by picking the row.
 *
 * 2. **AN AMBIGUOUS VENUE IS NOT OFFERED.** GMX lists several markets on one base pair
 *    ("BTC/USD [WBTC.b-USDC]" and "BTC/USD [BTC-USDC]" are different markets with different
 *    collateral). Where a venue OTHER than the tapped row's has more than one market for the
 *    symbol on that chain, there is no non-arbitrary answer to which one is meant — so it is left
 *    out, and the member reaches it by tapping its own row. `gmxMarkets.js` refuses the same way.
 *
 * 3. **NOTHING IS INVENTED.** Handles (`pairIndex`, `market`), collateral sets and limits come
 *    from the venue's own feed. Where the feed did not publish one, the option is still built and
 *    `openEligibility` refuses it WITH THE VENUE NAMED — the sheet then explains instead of
 *    offering a control that cannot submit.
