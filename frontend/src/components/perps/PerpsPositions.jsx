/**
 * PerpsPositions (spec 082 US2, extended by spec 083 US1/US2) — the connected account's open
 * positions per venue.
 *
 * Self-hides when there is nothing to say (disconnected / unsupported / idle) — the Predict
 * PositionsList convention. Per-venue honesty: an unreadable venue is disclosed by name while the
 * others render; an account with no positions gets a quiet empty state, not an error.
 *
 * MANAGEMENT IS PER-VENUE NOW, AND THAT IS THE POINT OF THIS FILE'S CHANGE. Phase 0 stated
 * globally that "positions are managed on the venue — there are no in-app controls". That sentence
 * was true then and is false now for **Gains and GMX** (FR-002/FR-003): a row on those venues opens
 * the PositionSheet, where a member closes, reduces and protects the position with their own
 * wallet. It remains true for **Hyperliquid**, which stays read-only this release (FR-021) — its L1
 * actions need a browser-held agent key even to close, so there is no in-app control to offer and a
 * disabled one would be the dishonest outcome. The statement is therefore rendered per venue, from
 * the venues actually on screen, rather than asserted once over all of them.
 *
 * THE VENUE LINK-OUT STAYS ON EVERY ROW, always, as the secondary action. It is the never-stranded
 * path: it is present when the management feature is off, when a venue is one this build cannot
 * manage, and when the app cannot transact at all. Nothing here may ever be the only way out.
 *
 * The management gate lives in ONE place — the caller (`PerpsView`) — and arrives as
 * `canManage(position)`. This component asks the question and never answers it: a second copy of
 * that predicate is how a control ends up offered where the calldata path does not exist.
