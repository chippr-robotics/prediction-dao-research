/**
 * PositionSheet (spec 083, T034 + T040) — how a member exits a leveraged position.
 *
 * This is the surface US1 and US2 are the acceptance criteria for, and the one where a
 * well-meaning shortcut costs a member real money. Five rules shape every line below:
 *
 * 1. **THE MEMBER IS ALWAYS `msg.sender`.** This component never touches an ownership field. It
 *    assembles a descriptor of *what the member asked for* and hands it to `usePerpsTrade`, which
 *    hands it to the venue builders — and those refuse an order FairWins would own. The only
 *    FairWins address that can leave here is `uiFeeReceiver`, and it travels as its own named
 *    parameter into `buildClosePositionCalls`/`buildProtectionCalls`, never near `receiver`.
 *
 * 2. **INCLUSION IS NEVER EXECUTION.** No status is derived here. `usePerpsTrade` publishes the
 *    state machine (`lib/perps/orderState.js`) and this file renders `trade.statusText` verbatim,
 *    so "Sent to Gains" on inclusion and "Position closed." only on the venue's own execution event
 *    are properties of the machine, not of this sheet. There is deliberately no local `done` flag —
 *    that is exactly the shape (`VaultSheet.jsx`'s `txState.step === 'done'`) that turns a stalled
 *    submission into a claim of success. A Gains protection change settles inside the member's own
 *    transaction and emits no order event, so it is the one action with nothing to watch — and it
 *    is confirmed by RE-READING the venue (`confirmStoredProtection`), never by inclusion. That
 *    read is bounded, and when the bound is spent the machine is told the thread was lost.
 *
 * 3. **EXITS ARE NEVER GATED.** Nothing here imports the attestation, the management kill switch,
 *    or the venue's open-permission check — a sibling test greps this file for each of those names,
 *    so they cannot return even as a comment. `exitAvailability()` is the only venue-status call,
 *    and it is consulted purely to render the venue's own warning — its
 *    `offer` is structurally `true`. An unreadable fee rate, an unreadable venue and a session that
 *    cannot transact all produce an explanation plus the venue's own link; none of them removes the
 *    exit. A sibling test asserts the absence of those imports over this file's source.
 *
 * 4. **HONEST NUMBERS.** Every figure is the venue's, rendered '—' where the venue reported
 *    nothing (never 0), and every pre-execution figure is labelled *estimated*. The position's
 *    facts come from the venue read; the close preview is arithmetic over those facts and says so.
 *
 * 5. **SMART DEFAULTS, ONE TAP.** "Close all" is pre-selected, protection is pre-filled from
 *    `defaults.js#suggestProtection` (which guarantees a level `validateProtection` accepts), and
 *    the slippage default is the venue SDK's own. A member who agrees with all of it taps once.
 *
 * TESTABILITY. Every side effect is injectable through `deps` — the trade hook, the fee read and
 * the clock — so the whole lifecycle is exercised with no network.

   *
   * 2. **`onClose` rides a ref instead of being a dependency.** This sheet lives inside a view
   *    that re-renders on a 30s market poll and a 60s position poll, so a caller passing an inline
   *    `onClose` would re-run the effect on each one: the cleanup restores focus, the effect then
   *    records THAT as the element to restore to and pulls focus back to the sheet — a member
   *    typing a stop-loss price would be yanked to the top of the sheet every poll, and the real
   *    return target would be lost. Keyed on the sheet's own identity, the shell runs exactly once
   *    per open, which is what "save and restore focus" means.
