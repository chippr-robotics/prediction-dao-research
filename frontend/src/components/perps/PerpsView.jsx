/**
 * PerpsView (spec 082, extended by spec 083) — the Perps view inside the Trade section
 * (`?view=perps`).
 *
 * One merged, searchable market-data surface over Gains Network / GMX / Hyperliquid, the connected
 * account's positions, and the orders a venue is still holding. Every state is honest
 * (FR-004/FR-005/FR-013): loading, ready, per-venue degraded (named, with the healthy venues still
 * rendering), fully unavailable, and the testnet-cohort notice (FR-017). The Hyperliquid builder
 * fee is disclosed here BEFORE any link-out when configured above zero — zero means no fee line at
 * all (FR-010).
 *
 * THIS FILE IS WHERE SPEC 083's COMPOSITION DECISIONS LIVE, and there are three of them:
 *
 * 1. **The management gate is here and only here.** `canManage` is
 *    `perpsManageFeatureEnabled() && perpsManageEnabled(venue, chainId)` — the release kill switch
 *    AND the per-venue/per-chain capability. With the flag off no management control renders
 *    anywhere: the view is exactly the spec-082 read-only surface, because a disabled or dead
 *    button would be the dishonest outcome (`config/perps.js`). Nothing downstream re-derives this
 *    — `PositionSheet` and `PerpsPendingOrders` deliberately cannot even read the flag, so a
 *    second copy of the question here is the only way it could be answered inconsistently.
 *
 * 2. **The stuck-order list is NOT behind that flag.** An order the venue never executed is holding
 *    the member's collateral, and US4 acceptance 3 is explicit: a recovery control is never gated by
 *    screening, jurisdiction, killswitch **or feature flag** (FR-005 / SC-004). It is mounted
 *    whenever an account is connected — including in the market-data-unavailable branch, because a
 *    pairs feed being down says nothing about whether a member can get their collateral back. It
 *    self-hides when there is genuinely nothing to say, so with the flag off and no stuck order the
 *    view renders as it always did.
 *
 * 3. **It sits ABOVE the positions list.** A stuck order is more urgent than a healthy position.
 *
 * The one thing the cohort gate still governs is whether this build reads MAINNET venues at all:
 * on a testnet cohort every venue read is passed a null account / a false `available()`, so no
 * cross-cohort read happens (constitution III), and the notice renders instead of the data.

   * A position read carries what the member is holding, not what the market is doing: neither the

   * only a position has no price at all. That is not cosmetic — `closeTradeMarket(index, price)`
   * takes the price its slippage bound is measured from, so with no price the sheet can only refuse
   * the close (which it did, honestly, and which made US1 unreachable in the assembled view).
   *
   * The venue's own live price is already on screen one section up — it is what the pairs table
   * renders — so it is passed down rather than read again. Matched on VENUE FIRST: one venue's
   * price may never stand in for another's, and a pair only one venue lists must not silently
   * borrow the other's number. `allPairs`, not `pairs`, because the latter is filtered by the
   * member's own search box. No match leaves it null, and null renders '—' and refuses the close —
   * the honest outcome, never a guessed price.
   *
   * GMX IS MATCHED ON THE MARKET ADDRESS, NOT THE SYMBOL, and that is not a shortcut around the
   * resolution above — it is stricter than it. GMX lists several markets on one base pair
   * ("BTC/USD [WBTC.b-USDC]" and "BTC/USD [BTC-USDC]" are different markets), so a symbol match
   * would have two candidates on the position's own chain and would take whichever came first.
