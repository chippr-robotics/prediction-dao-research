/**
 * OpenPositionSheet (spec 083, T050 + T052) — how a member opens a leveraged position.
 *
 * US3 is the acceptance criteria, and SC-006 is the shape of the whole file: the sheet arrives
 * ALREADY CONFIGURED, and the member changes at most two fields (normally the amount and the
 * leverage) to submit a valid order. Five rules shape every line below.
 *
 * 1. **THE MEMBER IS ALWAYS `msg.sender`.** This component never touches an ownership field. It
 *    assembles a descriptor of what the member asked for and hands it to `usePerpsTrade`, which
 *    hands it to the venue builders — and those refuse an order FairWins would own. The only
 *    FairWins address that can leave here is `uiFeeReceiver`, which travels as its own named GMX
 *    parameter in `buildOpenDescriptor`, never near `receiver`. Gains gets no referrer at all.
 *
 * 2. **INCLUSION IS NEVER EXECUTION.** No status is derived here. `usePerpsTrade` publishes the
 *    machine (`lib/perps/orderState.js`) and this file renders `trade.statusText` verbatim, so
 *    "Sent to Gains" on inclusion and "Position opened." only on the venue's own execution event
 *    are properties of the machine. There is deliberately no local `done` flag, and the sheet never
 *    describes a position until the venue has made one.
 *
 * 3. **THIS IS THE ENTRY PATH — the one place a gate belongs.** Screening and the jurisdiction
 *    attestation are wired into the trade hook here, for the one action (`open`) the hook treats as
 *    an entry. Nothing on this sheet can reach a close, a reduce or a recovery, and no exit-path
 *    module may import it; `test/perps/safetyInvariants.test.js` classifies this file as ENTRY and
 *    fails the build if that changes.
 *
 * 4. **HONEST NUMBERS.** Every preview figure is an ESTIMATE from the venue's own published
 *    numbers and is labelled as one (FR-009): there is no fill price, no actual size and no venue
 *    liquidation price until the venue executes. A figure that cannot be derived renders '—', never
 *    0. The FairWins rate is read from the contract that enforces it, a zero rate renders no fee
 *    line at all, and an UNREADABLE rate blocks opening — the one asymmetry with the exit sheet,
 *    and it is deliberate (fee-rails.md rule 4).
 *
 * 5. **NEVER A DEAD CONTROL.** A venue that is close-only, paused, unreadable, unsupported on this
 *    build, or whose own handle for this pair we cannot resolve is NOT OFFERED — the sheet states
 *    the reason with the venue named as its source and links to the venue's own app. What is
 *    offered is what can actually work.
 *
 * TESTABILITY: every side effect is injectable through `deps` — the trade hook, the fee read, the
 * venue quote, the allowance read and the attestation — so the whole lifecycle runs with no network.
