 * stop exists. The confirmation is therefore a READ — the venue's own `getTrade` — and US2

 * 2. **It is BOUNDED, and exhaustion is honest.** A read that never catches up must not spin: after

 *    machine in `unknown` with the venue's own surface one tap away — never a false success, and
 *    never a spinner with no end.
 * 3. **A change must be PROVEN, not assumed.** An RPC endpoint a block or two behind still answers
 *    the pre-write values, and accepting that would report the OLD level as the new one. So a read
 *    settles only when every leg that was written has moved off the value the venue held before —
