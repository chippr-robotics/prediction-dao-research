/**
 * SubmitAppPanel (spec 073 T034/T035, US3 · FR-021/FR-023) — the vendor's side of the registry.
 *
 * The catalog is what members see; this is where the listings come from. A developer submits a new
 * listing, submits a new package for one they already own, edits its reviewed metadata, and watches
 * what the curator queue has done with all of it. Every write lands on the SAME registry the host
 * launches from (`miniAppChainId()`), because a submission recorded anywhere else would be invisible
 * to the surface that decides what runs.
 *
 * Four rules shape this file, and each one exists because the obvious alternative misleads a vendor.
 *
 * **1. AN UPDATE DOES NOT TAKE THE APP OFFLINE, AND IT DOES NOT SHIP (FR-003).** This is the single
 * most misunderstandable fact on the surface, so it is stated as prose next to every control that
 * causes it — never as a tooltip, never once at the top. `submitUpdate` and `updateMetadata` write the
 * record's PROPOSED tuple and reset `status` to Pending; they do not touch the APPROVED tuple, which
 * is the only tuple a host ever serves. So a vendor with a live app keeps serving the package a
 * curator already reviewed for the whole time the new one sits in the queue — and, symmetrically,
 * nothing they submit reaches a member until a curator approves it. A vendor who believes either half
 * wrongly does real damage: one who thinks an update goes live immediately ships untested behavior in
 * their head, and one who thinks it takes them offline never updates at all.
 *
 * **2. THE VERSION NUMBER IS THE CONTRACT'S TO ISSUE, AND WE DO NOT GUESS IT.** There is no version
 * field on any form here. `MiniAppRegistry` keeps a per-app high-water mark (`lastVersion`) that it
 * increments on every submission and NEVER reuses, including across rejections — so a compliance log
 * cannot say "v2 rejected" and later "v2 approved" about different bytes. That mark is private state
 * with no getter, and it can legitimately be HIGHER than either live tuple (a rejected proposal is
 * cleared, its number is not). Predicting "your update will be v3" from the tuples on screen would
 * therefore be wrong exactly when a vendor has had something rejected — the moment they are paying
 * closest attention. So the panel shows the versions that exist and says plainly that the registry
 * issues the next one.
 *
 * **3. THE CHAIN IS AUTHORITATIVE; OUR CHECKS ARE A COURTESY.** Everything validated here mirrors a
 * rule `MiniAppRegistry` enforces itself (name bounds in BYTES, control bytes, blank-after-folding,
 * CID and manifest-hash presence) — the point is to spend a vendor's time instead of their gas, not
 * to become a second gate. Where our check is stricter than the chain's (an unrecognised CID shape, a
 * manifest that does not hash to the entered value, a name that cannot become a URL slug) the panel
 * says so and says why it matters, and a definite hash mismatch is the only client-side finding that
 * holds up a submission — behind an explicit acknowledgement, because a vendor who understands the
 * consequence is allowed to proceed. We never silently refuse what the registry would have accepted.
 *
 * **4. A REFUSAL EXPLAINS ITSELF.** Wrong network is blocked at submit time with the direction to fix
 * it, never a dead button and never a silent no-op. Every custom error the registry can revert with is
 * decoded into a sentence a developer can act on, including the membership tier requirement — read
 * from the registry's own gate config rather than assumed, because the gate is admin-configurable and
 * differs per deployment.
 *
 * Writes go through the wallet's unified `sendCalls`, so a passkey smart-account session (no ethers
 * signer, one sponsored UserOp) and a classic injected wallet both work without a second code path.
