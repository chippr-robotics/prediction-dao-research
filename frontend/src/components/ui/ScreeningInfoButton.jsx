      <h4>How address screening works</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Every list, every network.</strong> An address is checked against the FairWins
          sanctions guard, the Chainalysis sanctions oracle and the USDC / USDT issuer freeze
          lists on every network this build can read. Expand the pill to see each answer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Green means all of them answered clear.</strong> One flag from any list is
          <em> Flagged</em>. One list that could not be read is <em>Partly screened</em> — never
          green, because a missing answer is not a clear one.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Advisory only.</strong> The pill is a pre-check. It does <em>not</em> block
          anything by itself; the on-chain guard screens every participant independently, and an
          issuer freeze is enforced by the token itself.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fails closed.</strong> If no list can be reached, the address shows as
          <em> Unscreened</em> — never as clear.
        </li>
      </ul>
