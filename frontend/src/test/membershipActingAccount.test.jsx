/**
 * Membership belongs to an ADDRESS, so it must be read for the account the member is ACTING AS.
 *
 * The regression: `useRoleDetails` resolved its address from wagmi's `useAccount()` — the
 * CONNECTED wallet. Switching the acting account (multisig vault, recovered account, hardware
 * account) left the membership card showing the connected wallet's tier and expiry. A member
 * operating as a vault saw "GOLD" over an account that held nothing.
 *
 * It is not a cosmetic mismatch. `MembershipManager.purchaseTier` credits `msg.sender` and takes
 * no beneficiary, and every gated action — creating a wager, registering a callsign — is sent BY
 * the acting account, so the contract checks the acting account's membership. The card was
 * claiming an entitlement the chain would refuse.
 *
 * Fixing this could not be done in WalletContext: `CustodyProvider` nests INSIDE `WalletProvider`,
 * so the context that knows the acting account is invisible from the one that loads roles.
