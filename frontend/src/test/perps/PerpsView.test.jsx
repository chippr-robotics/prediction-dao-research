/**
 * PerpsView (spec 082, extended by spec 083) — view states: ready (merged table + badges),
 * per-venue degraded banner, unavailable, testnet cohort, fee disclosure (gated on Hyperliquid
 * management being AVAILABLE, which it is not — so absent at every rate, zero or not, with the
 * true economics stated instead), external marking + risk disclosure on link-outs.
 *
 * Spec 083 adds the COMPOSITION assertions, which are the ones a reviewer cannot make by eye:
 *
 *   - with the management flag OFF — the state CI runs in and the state most members will see —
 *     the view is the phase-0 read-only surface: no manage control, no sheet, nothing to click;
 *   - with it ON, a row on a venue this build can manage opens the PositionSheet, and a row on
 *     Hyperliquid does not (FR-021: read-only this release, and never a dead control);
 *   - the stuck-order list sits ABOVE the positions list, and — deliberately — is NOT behind the
 *     flag, because a recovery control may never be gated by one (US4 acceptance 3 / SC-004).
