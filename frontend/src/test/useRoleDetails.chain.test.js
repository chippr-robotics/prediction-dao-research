// ── WHAT THIS GUARDS, AND WHY IT CHANGED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Spec 008 pinned membership/role details to the WALLET's connected chain: the address used to be
// build-bound while the provider was the wallet's, a mismatch that could read a membership on the
// wrong network.
//
// Spec 071 (FR-003) supersedes that. Membership lives in exactly one place per environment cohort,
// so both the address AND the provider come from the REFERENCE chain and therefore still cannot
// disagree — the original mismatch stays fixed, by a stronger rule.
//
// The old version of this test mocked the wallet onto chain 80002 and asserted the resolver was
// called with 80002. In a testnet build 80002 IS the reference chain, so that assertion passed
// whichever chain the code actually used — it could not fail. The wallet is now deliberately put
// on a DIFFERENT cohort chain so the two answers are distinguishable.
const { resolver, web3, referenceChainId } = vi.hoisted(() => ({
  resolver: vi.fn(() => undefined),
  // Mordor (63): a real cohort chain, and NOT the reference chain (Amoy 80002).
  web3: { chainId: 63, provider: { ok: true }, switchNetwork: () => {}, account: '0xabc', isConnected: true },
  referenceChainId: 80002,
}))
