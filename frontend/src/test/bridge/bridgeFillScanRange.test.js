/**
 * The destination fill scan's block range (spec 067, FR-009 / FR-053).
 *
 * `readDestinationFill` is the only thing in the app allowed to promote a bridge to `delivered`
 * without the gateway, and its entire output is a fill transaction hash read from the destination
 * chain's SpokePool. It used to ask for that in ONE `eth_getLogs` spanning the whole six-hour
 * lookback — 10,800 blocks on Polygon, Optimism and Base and 86,400 on Arbitrum — against endpoints
 * that cap a single request at 10,000 blocks. Verified live against the real Polygon SpokePool:
 *
 *     lookback 10800 -> HTTP 413 {"code":-32614,"message":"eth_getLogs is limited to a 10,000 range"}
 *     lookback 10001 -> HTTP 413 (same)
 *     lookback 10000 -> OK, 347 logs
 *
 * Only Ethereum's 1,800 blocks fit. The failure was HONEST — a refused range is caught and returns
 * null, which the state machine reads as "no new information", so nobody was ever falsely told a
 * transfer had not arrived — but the fill hash was unreachable on four of the five bridging chains,
 * which is the whole point of the function.
 *
 * These pin three things:
 *   1. the per-chain lookback arithmetic, so a change to `FILL_LOOKBACK_SECONDS` or a block-time
 *      estimate is a deliberate act rather than a silent one;
 *   2. that no single request ever exceeds the cap, on every chain, whatever the arithmetic says;
 *   3. that the honest-degradation contract survives the fix — a scan that cannot be read is still
 *      null (no new information), never a false "not delivered".
