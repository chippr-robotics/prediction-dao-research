 * the build was for. A classic wallet is unaffected because an injected connector reports
 * its own chain; a passkey account has no wallet to ask, so the connector is the only thing
 * that can answer — and it was answering with a constant.
 *
 * On a mainnet build 137 was accidentally right, which is why it went unnoticed. On a
 * testnet-cohort build it is a read across the testnet/mainnet boundary that constitution
 * III forbids outright, and it reached members as a false statement: the wager create path
 * looked up the opponent's X25519 key in the WRONG chain's KeyRegistry, found nothing, and
 * told the member their opponent had not registered a key.
 *
 * `getCurrentChainId()` is the build's own home network (`VITE_NETWORK_ID`, else
 * `PRIMARY_CHAIN_ID`) and the same value `buildIsTestnet()` derives the cohort from — so this
 * stays truthful per build without a second literal `137` to drift, exactly as
 * `membershipChainId()` avoids one.
 *
 * Falls back to wagmi's default only when the build chain is not registered in `chains`:
 * wagmi refuses to store an unconfigured chain id, so reporting one would leave the session
 * claiming a chain the config cannot represent. That fallback is the exact state this function
 * exists to prevent, and only a broken build can reach it (a non-numeric `VITE_NETWORK_ID` parses
 * to `NaN`; every id in `NETWORKS` is registered in `wagmi.js#chains`), so it says so loudly
 * rather than silently putting a testnet build back on Polygon.
