// Spec 043 (US3) — expose the active identity and a single submit() that every money-moving surface can call.
// In personal mode submit sends via the connected signer; in vault mode it creates a threshold-gated proposal.
//
// Spec 088 — recovered and hardware identities are ADDRESS-ONLY until value moves: submit()
// fetches the acting signer on demand through the custody broker (the globally-mounted ceremony
// host renders the unlock / device-connect dialog right then). A cached signer bound to a network
// the wallet has since left is DROPPED and re-requested — the fresh ceremony binds to the current
// chain — instead of failing the send with a "switch back" error.
//
// Spec 088 FR-002 (audit) — submit() has NO fall-through for an unhandled acting kind. Any mode
// that is not 'personal' and has no branch of its own is REFUSED, never sent with the CONNECTED
// wallet's signer under somebody else's label.
//
// Spec 102 (D6, FR-014) — a vault-mode submit whose wallet is on another chain SWITCHES FIRST
// (`useEarnSend.sendOnChain` precedent): `switchNetwork` is awaited and rejects on refusal, then
// the send waits for the wallet snapshot to settle on the vault's chain (and, for a classic wallet,
// for the chain-scoped signer to be rebuilt) before the proposal is created with the SETTLED
// signer/provider — never the one captured at tap time. A refusal is a stated error naming both
// chains, and nothing is signed. The auto-switch adds a wallet prompt; it never removes one.
