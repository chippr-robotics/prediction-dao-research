/**
 * Spec 022 — Membership Purchase Progress Indicator.
 *
 * Step state machine that drives the dedicated "Processing" view of
 * PremiumPurchaseModal. It surfaces the real wallet interactions of a membership
 * purchase as discrete, labeled steps with live state, and supports safe recovery:
 *
 *   approve (optional) -> pay -> sign -> register
 *
 * - The approve step is OMITTED when the member already has sufficient allowance
 *   (FR-009), determined by a read-only pre-flight (`checkApprovalNeeded`).
 * - approve/pay are surfaced via the `onProgress` callback of
 *   `purchaseRoleWithStablecoin`; sign/register are orchestrated here.
 * - sign/register are non-blocking: the membership is already active once `pay`
 *   confirms, so a key-step failure offers Retry AND Continue anyway (FR-010).
 * - Retry resumes from the failed step without re-running the payment (FR-008).
 *
 * This hook changes NO purchase mechanics (FR-001a); it only observes and
 * sequences the existing calls.
 *
 * ── Spec 098 — purchasing AS THE ACTING ACCOUNT ────────────────────────────────
 * `MembershipManager.purchaseTier` credits `msg.sender` and takes no beneficiary, so a membership
 * lands on the acting account if and only if the ACTING account signs. The caller therefore hands
 * the flow a BINDING (`params.acting`) plus exactly one rail:
 *
 *   params.proposePurchase  → vault rail: one threshold-gated Safe proposal. Terminal state is
 *                             `proposed`, never `succeeded` — nothing has been paid yet, so onPaid
 *                             never fires and the key steps are skipped (a Safe cannot sign,
 *                             spec 084).
 *   params.getActingSigner  → classic acting rail: the spec-088 ceremony broker hands back the
 *                             acting account's signer at CONFIRM time. It is resolved ONCE per run
 *                             (cached for the whole flow), address-checked against the binding, and
 *                             is what signs approve+pay, the relayed intent, the key derivation and
 *                             the key registration.
 *   params.batchPurchase    → passkey rail (spec 041), personal-only; unchanged.
 *   (none)                  → classic personal rail; unchanged.
 *
 * The binding is immutable for the life of a run: `invalidateIdentity(reason)` fails the flow and
 * permanently blocks retry, so no later step can execute under a NEW identity (FR-013).
