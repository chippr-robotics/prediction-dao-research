/**
 * useWrapNative — wrap the connected network's coin into its canonical wrapped form,
 * and unwrap it back.
 *
 * Wrapping is NOT a swap and NOT a bridge: `deposit()` mints exactly what you send and
 * `withdraw(wad)` burns exactly what you ask for, against the network's own WETH9-shaped
 * contract (config/wrappedNative.js). There is no price, no slippage, no counterparty and
 * no quote to expire — so this hook deliberately exposes none of those, and the view must
 * not invent them. The only cost is the network fee.
 *
 * Routing mirrors useTransfer, because "who is acting" is the same question here:
 *
 *   vault    → a threshold-gated proposal (nothing moves until the signers approve)
 *   legacy   → signed by the unlocked recovered key, never the connected wallet
 *   hardware → signed on the device via the deferred ceremony (spec 088), never the connected wallet
 *   passkey  → one smart-account call (sponsored where the chain runs a paymaster)
 *   classic  → a plain transaction, sender pays the network fee
 *
 * Gas honesty: unwrapping costs native coin the member is about to receive, and wrapping
 * costs native coin out of the same balance being wrapped — so `maxWrappable` holds back a
 * reserve rather than offering the whole balance and letting the wallet reject it. The
 * reserve is quoted from the chain's own fee data, not a constant.
 *
 * Spec 108 — the hook takes an explicit TARGET chain (`useWrapNative({ chainId })`), so the
 * asset is the entry point rather than the connected network. Every read re-binds to the
 * target (wrapper, provider, fee reserve, sponsorship, on-chain label); the write retargets
 * per rail:
 *
 *   classic, same chain   → plain transaction, as ever
 *   classic, other chain  → switch-then-settle FIRST (the spec-102 `settleOnVaultChain` /
 *                           `useEarnSend.sendOnChain` device: awaited switch, then a 150 ms
 *                           poll on a render-updated snapshot until the chain matches and the
 *                           chain-scoped signer exists, 20 s deadline). A refusal names BOTH
 *                           chains and sends nothing.
 *   passkey               → the batch is chain-targeted BY PARAMETER
 *                           (`sendCalls(calls, { chainId })`) — no switch ceremony exists or
 *                           is needed — offered only where `isPasskeySupported(target)`;
 *                           elsewhere the rail is stated as unavailable BEFORE the tap, with
 *                           the support seam's own reason (the write-rail rule).
 *   vault/legacy/hardware → unchanged acting-account refusals; the view pins the picker to
 *                           the acting account's own chain, so a foreign target never
 *                           reaches these rails.
 *
 * Callers that pass no target get the wallet's chain — byte-compatible with every
 * pre-108 caller.
