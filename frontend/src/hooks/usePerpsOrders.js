/**
 * usePerpsOrders (spec 083, T031, US4) — the member's PENDING and STUCK orders across venues.
 *
 * This is the data behind the recovery control, and it is ON THE EXIT PATH. Nothing here may
 * consult screening, the jurisdiction attestation, the management kill switch, or venue "may they
 * open" state: an order holding collateral in limbo with no visible control is indistinguishable
 * from lost money (US4), so the list is produced under every restriction the product has. The
 * module deliberately imports none of those gates — a sibling test asserts that over this file's
 * own source, the same way `test/perps/safetyInvariants.test.js` does for the lib modules.
 *
 * TWO SOURCES, ONE SHAPE:
 *
 *   - **Gains** pending orders arrive from the gateway (`/v1/perps/positions` → `pendingOrders`).
 *     A payload WITHOUT that key is read as "this gateway does not report them yet", NOT as "the
 *     member has none" — an older gateway build is an unread venue, and an absent key must never
 *     render as proven absence. The pending-order facet has its own readiness signal
 *     (`sources.gains.pendingOrderChains`), and `sources.gains.status` — which is the POSITIONS
 *     facet — is deliberately not consulted; see `loadGainsOrders`.
 *   - **GMX** frozen/pending orders are folded from the account's own `EventLog2` history on the
 *     app's read provider. That choice is deliberate and is written up in the header of
 *     `loadGmxOrders`.
 *
 * STATE IS NEVER RE-DERIVED HERE. Every order's state comes out of `lib/perps/orderState.js` —
 * the venue's events (or the venue's own pending-order storage) driven through the machine. This
 * hook decides *which* orders to show and *whether a recovery call exists*; it never decides what
 * a state means, and it never maps a receipt to `executed`.
 *
 * HONEST NUMBERS. A value the venue did not report is `null` and renders '—'. An unreadable venue
 * is named in `unreadableVenues` and contributes NO orders — so **an empty `orders` is proven
 * absence only when `unreadableVenues` is empty**. Callers must render that distinction.
 *
 * Conventions carried over from `usePerpsPositions.js`: a 60s poll, a request-id stale guard, a
 * synchronous hard reset before paint on account change, per-venue isolation, injectable deps.

/**
 * GMX orders, folded from `EventLog2` history on the app's read provider.
 *
 * WHY THE EVENT HISTORY AND NOT THE READER/DATASTORE. Three reasons, in order of weight:
 *
 *   1. **A frozen order's REASON only exists in the event.** US4 requires a frozen order to be
 *      presented with the venue's own stated reason (FR-008), and GMX states it as its own error
 *      name inside `OrderFrozen`'s `EventLogData`. `Order.Props` has no reason field, so a Reader
 *      read could list the order and would still have to say '—' for why it is stuck.
 *   2. **The Reader path would need an unverified ABI.** `abis/perps/gmxReader.js` carries exactly
 *      one function, verified by decoding live returndata, and its header explains why a
 *      hand-written GMX tuple is dangerous: a wrong field list decodes without error and produces
 *      garbage. Adding `getAccountOrders` on the strength of a memory of `Order.Props` would put a
 *      fabricated read in front of a member.
 *   3. The events are already pinned: `eventTopicsForAccount` and the `EventLog2` topic hash were
 *      checked against live Arbitrum logs, and `gmxEventSignal` already consumes exactly this
 *      shape — the state comes out of the machine rather than out of a flag we interpret.
 *
 * THE COST, DISCLOSED. A log read has a range, so an order frozen before `fromBlock` is not in
 * this list. `sources.gmx` carries `windowed`, `fromBlock` and `lookbackBlocks` so the surface can
 * say so and link to GMX, rather than presenting a windowed list as the whole truth.
 *
 * Never rejects.
