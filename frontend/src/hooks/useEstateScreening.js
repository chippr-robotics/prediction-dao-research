/**
 * useEstateScreening — one address, every source, every cohort chain (spec 021 amendment,
 * issue #1458). The React face of `lib/screening/screenEstate.js`.
 *
 * Distinct from `useAddressScreening`, which stays the PER-CHAIN screen: the surfaces that gate
 * a submission (Transfer, Pay, Bridge, Supply) still ask the guard on the chain the value moves
 * on, forced and live, because that is the read the contract will repeat. This hook answers the
 * broader question a member asks when they first paste an address — "is this address flagged
 * anywhere?" — and its result is advisory, never a gate.
 *
 * Returns `{ status, result, refresh }`:
 *   status  'idle' (no valid address) | 'loading' | 'done'
 *   result  an EstateScreeningResult on 'done', else null — so `result.verdict` cannot be read
 *           before it exists, and a loading pill is a distinct state, never a stale one.
 *
 * Status is DERIVED from (the address asked, the address answered): a result is only ever shown
 * for the address it was computed for, so typing a new address flips straight to 'loading'
 * without a synchronous setState in the effect.

/**
 * useEstateScreeningMany — the same sweep for a LIST of addresses, for the address book.
 *
 * Why the book needed this: its rows were still asking `useAddressScreening`, the per-chain guard
 * read, which can only answer for the chain the wallet is connected to. A contact saved on Amoy
 * while the wallet sat on Polygon — or any contact at all with no wallet connected — rendered
 * "Unscreened", so a member opening their book saw a column of amber that said nothing about the
 * addresses and everything about their wallet (issue #1458 QA round: thirteen contacts, thirteen
 * Unscreened, on a build where screening worked perfectly).
 *
 * Screening needs no wallet, so the book no longer pretends it does. Each unique address gets one
 * cohort sweep, shared through the module cache and in-flight de-duplication in `screenEstate`,
 * and the reads themselves batch per chain inside ethers.
 *
 *   getVerdict(address)             the whole-estate verdict, or null while it is still running
 *   getVerdictOn(address, chainId)  that network's verdict, or null when nothing screens there
 *   resultFor(address)              the full result, for a caller that wants the readings
