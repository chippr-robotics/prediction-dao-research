/**
 * Fee state across the whole estate (spec 071 US3, FR-021…FR-023).
 *
 * ── WHAT ACTUALLY ACCRUES, AND WHERE (research R6) ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * "All chains for accrued fees" needed a real answer about what accrues, and there is exactly
 * ONE accruing balance in the system:
 *
 *   ACCRUED (undrawn) — `MembershipManager.accruedFees()`, withdrawable via `withdrawFees`.
 *                       Deployed on the reference chain and the testnet/local networks only.
 *   RECEIVED          — the treasury's payment-token balance on each chain carrying a
 *                       `FeeRouter`. The FeeRouter itself holds NOTHING: it forwards the fee to
 *                       the treasury inside the same transaction (spec 060), by design.
 *
 * These are never added together. One is money the platform still owes itself; the other is
 * money already delivered. Summing them would invent a third number that is neither.
 *
 * ── AND WHY THERE IS NO GRAND TOTAL ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Payment tokens differ per chain — Polygon holds USDC, Mordor holds Classic USD. `aggregate`
 * returns per-unit subtotals and refuses to cross them (FR-022), and any total computed while a
 * chain was unreadable is flagged `partial` and names what is missing (FR-023). A chain that
 * simply has no deployment reads `not-deployed`, which is a fact rather than a gap.
