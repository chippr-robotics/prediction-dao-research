/**
 * useEarnSend (spec 050) — network-transparent transaction sending for the
 * Earn section. Vaults and rewards span every earn-enabled network (like the
 * portfolio), so the member never manages networks by hand: when a
 * transaction targets a different chain than the active one, the switch
 * happens automatically as part of submitting — no separate "switch network"
 * step to confirm in the app. (A browser wallet may still show its own
 * switch prompt; that surface belongs to the wallet, not us.)
 *
 * After switching we wait for the session to settle on the target chain —
 * and, for classic wallets, for the signer to be rebuilt — before handing the
 * batch to WalletContext.sendCalls, which reads the ACTIVE chain. A ref to
 * the latest wallet snapshot avoids acting on a stale closure mid-switch.
 *
 * ── ACTING ACCOUNTS ARE REFUSED, NOT SILENTLY IGNORED (spec 088 FR-001/FR-002) ───────
 * Every write here goes out on the CONNECTED wallet's own rail: `sendOnChain` ends at
 * `WalletContext.sendCalls`, which signs with whatever the wallet is holding, and the
 * network-switch above is a wagmi `switchChainAsync` on that SAME connected wallet — not the
 * acting-account seam (`submitAsActiveAccount`), which does not switch networks and binds
 * whatever signer it fetches to the wallet's CURRENT chain at ceremony time (spec 088 FR-005).
 * Every Earn surface here (vaults, staking, supply/bridge-LP, rewards) is defined by a target
 * that may be on a chain the wallet is not currently on, exactly the shape BridgeView already
 * refuses for the same reason. So `sendOnChain` refuses outright while the switcher shows a
 * vault, a recovered, a hardware, or any other non-personal account — belt and braces behind
 * whatever the calling surface's own UI does — rather than let a network-switching mid-flow
 * signature go out under the connected wallet while an acting label is showing. See
 * `frontend/src/components/wallet/BridgeView.jsx` for the withheld-surface half of this pattern.
