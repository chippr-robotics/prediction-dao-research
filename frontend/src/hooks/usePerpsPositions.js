/**
 * usePerpsPositions (spec 082 US2, extended by spec 083 T032) — the connected account's open perp
 * positions per venue, and the venue handles a sheet needs to act on one.
 *
 * TWO SOURCES, ONE LIST:
 *
 *   - **The gateway** (`/v1/perps/positions`) serves Gains and Hyperliquid. Since spec 083 each
 *     Gains position carries a `venueRef` — the identifiers the calldata builders consume. It is
 *     read DEFENSIVELY: a payload with no refs is an older gateway build, and those positions must
 *     still render (with `venueRef: null`) rather than disappearing from a member's own list.
 *   - **GMX** is read here, client-side, from GMX's `Reader.getAccountPositions` on Arbitrum. The
 *     gateway deliberately does not serve it (the GMX REST API does not expose positions), so the
 *     venue would otherwise be honestly absent forever. The app's read provider is used —
 *     `getReadProvider`, never a hand-built endpoint — so a member's own RPC settings apply
 *     (spec 069).
 *
 * PER-VENUE ISOLATION IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. A GMX read failure marks GMX unreadable and disturbs
 * nothing else; a gateway outage leaves the GMX positions on screen and NAMES the venues that went
 * missing, because an absent Gains position rendered silently reads as "you have no position".
 *
 * HONEST NUMBERS. Every value comes from the venue that reported it. GMX's Reader gives size in
 * 1e30 USD and nothing else this hook can price — collateral is in the collateral token's own
 * decimals with no price attached, and entry/leverage/PnL all need data the Reader does not fetch —
 * so those stay `null` and render '—'. None of them may become 0.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE MAY BECOME A GATE. This list is what a member closes a position FROM, so it is
 * produced under every restriction the product has: no attestation, no management kill switch, no
 * screening, and no "would the venue accept an open" question is consulted, and a sibling test
 * asserts that over this file's own source. `available()` is the spec-082 gateway/cohort switch and
 * stays exactly as phase 0 had it — it decides whether this build reads mainnet venues at all
 * (a testnet cohort must not, constitution III), not whether a member may manage what it finds.
 *
 * Conventions carried over from phase 0 and shared with `usePerpsOrders.js`: a 60s poll aligned
 * with the portfolio cadence, a request-id stale guard, a synchronous hard reset before paint on
 * account change, and injectable deps.
