/**
 * useGroupPay (release 1.14.0) — pay N recipients with one asset, on whatever rail the acting
 * identity actually has.
 *
 *   passkey account acting as itself → ONE `sendCalls` batch (one ceremony, one transaction)
 *   acting as a vault                → ONE MultiSend proposal (one threshold approval)
 *   classic wallet / recovered / hardware account → SEQUENTIAL sends through the existing
 *                                       transfer engine, with a per-recipient outcome
 *   anything else (a derived account) → REFUSED, with the reason
 *
 * Three properties are the whole point of the hook:
 *
 *   ONE SUBMISSION WHERE ONE IS POSSIBLE. A member paying five people from a passkey account
 *   confirms once, not five times, and pays one network fee rather than five.
 *
 *   NO ABORT ON THE FIRST FAILURE. On the sequential rail every recipient is attempted and
 *   every recipient gets its own reported outcome — the spec-062 `sweepAllAssets` precedent.
 *   A batch rail is genuinely all-or-nothing and says so instead of pretending otherwise.
 *
 *   SCREENING IS NOT SKIPPABLE. Every recipient is screened at SUBMIT time through the same
 *   seam the single-recipient path uses, forced past the cache (a "clear" from a minute ago is
 *   not a submission-time fact — the spec-067 FR-032 precedent). On a batch rail a flagged
 *   recipient stops the whole submission BEFORE anything is signed: silently dropping one leg
 *   of a batch the member just read and confirmed would submit something they never approved.
 *   On the sequential rail the payments are genuinely independent, so the flagged one is
 *   SKIPPED with its reason and the rest go through.
