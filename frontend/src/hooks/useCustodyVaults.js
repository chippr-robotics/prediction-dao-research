// Spec 043 — vault list + create/load orchestration for the Custody On chain section (US1). Reads the
// member's saved vault references, enriches each with live on-chain state, and exposes create/load actions
// that persist a reference. Honest state: on-chain reads are the source of truth; references are just labels.
//
// Spec 068 (US1) makes the list MULTI-CHAIN: every saved vault is listed with its own chain identity
// regardless of which network the wallet is on, each enriched through a read provider for ITS chain.
// Enrichment failures are isolated per vault — one unreachable network must never blank the list —
// and `onVaultChain` gates every state-changing action so nothing can be submitted to the wrong chain.
//
// Spec 102 — a vault is an ADDRESS. `vaults` stays the per-chain instance list (the policy panels and
// propose/approve still need instances), and `groups` is the one-card-per-address view over it
// (`lib/custody/vaultGroups`). Loading an address adds EVERY network it is a Safe on; forgetting a
// vault forgets every network; the member is never asked to pick a chain.
