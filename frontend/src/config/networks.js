/**
 * Per-chain configuration for the FairWins app.
 *
 * Single source of truth for chain metadata, contract addresses, stablecoin
 * info, DEX deployments, explorer URLs, and per-chain capabilities. Other
 * config (wagmi.js, contracts.js, blockExplorer.js, dex.js) derives from
 * this map.
 *
 * Supported chains:
 *   - Polygon Mainnet (137) — PRIMARY / production default. Canonical Uniswap
 *     V3 deployment; live v2 wager contracts.
 *   - Polygon Amoy (80002) — testnet. Co-locates with Polymarket's CTF for
 *     settle-by-reference; community Uniswap V3 contracts may be plugged in via
 *     VITE_AMOY_UNISWAP_* env vars.
 *   - Ethereum Classic (61) + Mordor (63) — ETCswap V3 swap surface + ClearPath
 *     (specs 033 / 042).
 *   - Ethereum family (spec 048) — value networks for select + portfolio +
 *     send/receive: Ethereum Mainnet (1, also ClearPath + Uniswap swap/liquidity
 *     as of spec 067), Hoodi (560048) and Sepolia (11155111) testnets. No wager
 *     infra is deployed here; that capability self-discloses as unavailable
 *     (honest-state).
 *   - Arbitrum One (42161), Base (8453), Optimism (10) — spec 067 bridge +
 *     liquidity networks, first-class for select/portfolio/send-receive. Each
 *     carries an Across SpokePool and a Uniswap V3 deployment.
 *   - Hardhat (1337) — local dev.
 *
 * Spec 067 note: `capabilities.dex` (in-app swapping) is an EXPLICIT allow-list
 * (SWAP_CHAIN_IDS) and `capabilities.liquidity` is derived separately. Adding
 * `dex` addresses to a network no longer switches swapping on by itself — see
 * the SWAP_CHAIN_IDS comment.
 *
 * Passkey note (spec 041): every EVM network here declares a `passkey` block and
 * derives `capabilities.passkeyAccounts` from it, because every one of them was
 * probed and can host the ERC-4337 account stack. Declaring the block enables
 * ops, not members: the capability stays false until a bundler URL is set, and UI
 * surfaces gate on `config/passkeySupport.js#isPasskeySupported`, which ALSO
 * requires the account factory to be deployed on that chain.
 *
 * The user-facing Testnet/Mainnet toggle switches between 80002 (testnet) and
 * 137 (mainnet) via wagmi.switchChain; every network with `selectable: true`
 * is also individually switchable from the My Account → Network tab.

 * the registry's testnet deployment is Mordor rather than Amoy (see `MINIAPP_TESTNET_CHAIN_ID`).
 * What must never happen is a hardcoded `137`: the catalog is not a display detail, it decides
 * which packages the host will fetch, verify, and EXECUTE (FR-010/FR-011), and reading approvals
 * from the wrong side of the cohort boundary would run mainnet-curated code against testnet
 * wallets.
 *
 * Deliberately its own function rather than an alias of `membershipChainId()`: the two answer
 * different questions — where membership is sold and read, versus where app curation is
 * governed — and as of the Polygon+Mordor deployment decision they no longer even resolve to the
 * same chain on a testnet build.
 *
 * Not runtime-configurable, deliberately. The registry is the trust boundary for what code the
 * host executes, so a runtime-swappable registry chain would let a misconfiguration (or a
 * tampered preference) point verification at a chain anyone can write to.
 *
 * ── THE ONE EXCEPTION, AND WHY IT DOES NOT WEAKEN THAT ──────────────────────────────────────
 * `E2E_AMOY_LOCAL` redirects this to the local node, and it is NOT a runtime configuration: it is
 * `import.meta.env.DEV && VITE_E2E_AMOY_LOCAL === '1'`, so a production build eliminates the
 * branch entirely and no preference, tampered or otherwise, can reach it. The sentence above is
 * about a *runtime-swappable* registry chain; this is a compile-time one, and it is the same gate
 * that already repoints the ENTIRE 80002 address map to `HARDHAT_CONTRACTS` in config/contracts.js
 * — a strictly larger surface, since that one moves the wager registry and the fee router too.
 *
 * It exists because the rules this registry enforces — `launchable` is the serving decision, an
 * approval is content-committed, screening happens inside `wallet.submit` — are exactly the kind a
 * refactor inverts silently, and none of them can be settled against a chain the test cannot
 * write to. Mordor is a public network: a flow test cannot submit a package there, approve it, and
 * then swap it under the curator. On the local node it can.
 *
 * The cohort boundary still holds, and holds MORE tightly than before: 80002 is `isTestnet: true`,
 * so a testnet build still reads a testnet registry. `src/test/networks.miniapps.test.js` pins the
 * production answers on both sides so this branch cannot drift into a shipped build.
