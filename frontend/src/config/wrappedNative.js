/**
 * Wrapped native coin — the network's own canonical WETH9-shaped contract.
 *
 * ONE resolver, because there were already two half-answers to "what is the wrapped
 * form of this chain's coin?": the DEX config's `wnative` (what swapping pairs
 * against) and the synced deployment record's `wmatic` key (what the wager/pool
 * contracts were configured with — despite the name it holds WETC on the Ethereum
 * Classic chains, not a Polygon token). Both point at the same contract wherever
 * both exist, and neither exists everywhere. Anything that needs the wrapped coin —
 * the portfolio registry, the Wrap view — resolves it here so a chain can never be
 * "wrappable" on one surface and absent on another.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO curated fallback table. An address that is not in the
 * app's own configuration is one nobody here verified, and wrapping sends the
 * member's coin to it: an unconfigured chain reports `null` and every surface says
 * so honestly (Constitution III) rather than guessing at a canonical deployment.
 *
 * `symbol`/`name` here are DERIVED labels for a surface that has to render before a
 * chain read returns. They are not authority: Polygon's contract, for one, has been
 * renamed on-chain (WMATIC → WPOL) while this config still calls the coin MATIC, so
 * a caller that can read the contract should prefer what the contract says about
 * itself and fall back to these.
