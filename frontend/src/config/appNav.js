 * Shared app-navigation model for the redesigned nav shell.

 *   - AppNavDrawer      — the global left drawer opened by the clover logo ("us")
 *   - SectionIconNav    — the mobile bottom icon bar for quick sub-section switching
 *   - WalletPage        — hosts the section panels, keyed by the same tab ids
 *
 * Every section item routes to `/wallet?tab=<id>` (the panels render there); the
 * Home entry is the dashboard. Account / Membership / Network / Preferences
 * intentionally live on the account button (top right), NOT in this menu, so they
 * are absent from the groups below.

 * wager is moving money to a counterparty under conditions, which is the same family of action as
 * a same-chain send and a cross-network bridge — so it belongs BESIDE them, as a third view of the
 * Transfer section, rather than as a separate destination members have to know to go looking for.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT re-added to `RAW_NAV_GROUPS`: a nav ITEM is a section, and a section owns
 * a `?tab=`. Wagers owns a `?view=` within one. `groupForTab('wagers')` therefore stays null (no
 * mobile bottom bar claims it as a sibling), and the only thing this constant governs is where
 * `pathForNavItem('wagers')` and the legacy `/wagers` redirect point.
 *
 * `tab` is the section that hosts it; `view` is PayTransferPanel's own `?view=` id. Both live here
 * so the route helper, the redirect, and the panel cannot drift into disagreeing about the URL.
