/**
 * Issued RPC access — the client half of spec 107.
 *
 * The gateway's `POST /v1/access/rpc` mints a short-lived, read-only credential for a dedicated
 * keyed endpoint; this module holds it and renews it. The SPA then reads DIRECTLY from the
 * provider — no read traffic is proxied — and nothing keyed is ever compiled into the build.
 *
 * ── THE THREE RULES THIS FILE EXISTS TO KEEP ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * MODULE MEMORY ONLY. The credential is never written through `endpointStore.commit()` — that
 * persists into `fw_global_prefs.network_endpoints`, which rides the device backup, and a test
 * asserts that key's absence from the synced set. An issued credential outliving its TTL in a
 * backup would be a stored secret nobody can revoke. Lose the tab, lose the token, mint again:
 * that is the design, not a limitation.
 *
 * THE RESOLUTION PATH STAYS SYNCHRONOUS. `resolveRpcEndpoints` is consumed during module
 * evaluation, inside render, and by the frozen mini-app host contract — it can never await.
 * So acquisition runs in the BACKGROUND (`ensureIssuedAccess`, fire-and-forget, single-flight)
 * and resolution reads whatever this module already holds, synchronously. Until the first mint
 * lands, reads ride the public default — degraded, working, honest.
 *
 * ROTATION MUST NOT CHURN THE APP. The endpoints revision is global: bumping it re-derives every
 * provider memo on every chain in every mounted hook, and the provider cache keys on headers, so
 * a token baked into either would tear down and rebuild providers on every renewal — including
 * the mini-app host's identity-stable wrappers, whose whole reason for existing is that a
 * changing provider identity in a package's effect deps was an infinite loop. So the revision
 * bumps ONLY on acquisition and loss (the URL appearing or disappearing — rare transitions), and
 * the TOKEN is read per request via `currentTokenFor`, reaching the wire through a preflight
 * hook on a provider whose identity never changes across renewals.
