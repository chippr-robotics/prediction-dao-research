/**
 * Deterministic two-word display names for wallet addresses (spec 040, US1 / FR-002).

 * When an opponent has no address-book nickname and no ENS reverse record, the My Wagers card still
 * needs a memorable, human-readable label instead of a bare `0x1234…ABCD`. This derives a stable
 * adjective-noun name from the address itself: the SAME address always renders the SAME name, so a
 * repeat opponent is recognizable across wagers and sessions.
 *
 * It reuses ONLY the shared vocabulary from the pool nicknames (spec 034); it is intentionally a
 * separate function from `deriveNickname`, which is keyed on a Semaphore identity commitment and is
 * pool-scoped. This one is address-keyed and pure client-side display — never written to chain.
