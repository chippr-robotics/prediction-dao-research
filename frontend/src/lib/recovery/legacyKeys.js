/**
 * Legacy key & word-list recovery (Recovery section).
 *
 * Many members arrive holding an *old* secret: a raw EOA private key, or a
 * BIP-39 word list (12/15/18/21/24 words) from a previous wallet. FairWins can
 * take custody of that secret ONLY on this device, encrypted at rest, and — the
 * important part — help the member move the funds off that legacy key onto a
 * modern passkey smart account, which is what the rest of the app protects.
 *
 * Security posture (mirrors the passkey blob approach in lib/passkey/prfKeys.js):
 *  - the raw secret is NEVER persisted in the clear and never leaves the device;
 *  - at rest it is wrapped with AES-GCM under a key stretched from a
 *    member-chosen passphrase (PBKDF2-SHA256), so localStorage alone is useless;
 *  - a wrong passphrase fails the AES-GCM tag — we never fall through to a
 *    different/empty secret.
 *
 * A legacy EOA is a liability, not a destination: the module makes "move the
 * funds to a smart account" the recommended follow-up, but it is OPTIONAL —
 * storing the key completes recovery on its own. When chosen, the move sweeps
 * ALL supported assets (native + supported ERC-20s), not just the native coin.
