/**
 * LiquidityRouter read + supply-call layer (spec 067).
 *
 * The Supply area reads its on-chain control surface at runtime: which pools are curated, of
 * which kind, their per-transaction ceilings, the Uniswap position manager in use, and the
 * per-network pause flag (FR-051). When the router is undeployed or unreadable this returns
 * `null` and the caller shows an honest unavailable state — availability is withheld, never
 * invented (FR-054). Same shape and same null-on-failure contract as
 * `lib/bridge/bridgeRouter.js` and `lib/staking/stakingRouter.js`, deliberately.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE TWO POOL KINDS ARE NOT SYMMETRIC. Read this before wiring any UI.
 *
 *   TRADING_LP (Uniswap V3) — routed through this contract, and fee-charged. The position
 *     NFT is minted straight to the member.
 *
 *   BRIDGE_LP (Across HubPool) — NOT routed through this contract, and FEE-FREE. Across's
 *     `addLiquidity` has no recipient parameter, so a fee-taking wrapper would own the LP
 *     tokens and the member could never exit (research R3). Those deposits are a DIRECT
 *     member call; see `lib/liquidity/acrossLpPositions.js`.
 *
 * So `buildSupplyCalls` REFUSES a bridge pool rather than producing calldata that reverts,
 * and `chargesPlatformFee(pool)` is false for one. A bridge pool must show NO fee line at
 * all — not a line reading 0.00, which would imply a lever that does not exist.
 *
 * Bridge liquidity is also ETHEREUM-ONLY (the Across HubPool is an L1 contract by design)
 * while trading liquidity is on all five mainnets. That asymmetry is a property of the
 * curated pool list, so it needs no special-casing here — but copy must state it plainly
 * rather than implying every network offers both kinds (research R8).
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * THE FEE IS CHARGED ON CAPITAL ACTUALLY DEPLOYED, NOT ON WHAT THE MEMBER OFFERS. Uniswap
 * consumes only what the current price ratio needs and refunds the rest, so `_supply` quotes
 * the fee AFTER the mint against the CONSUMED amounts. This module therefore exposes
 * `maxSupplyFee` — an explicit UPPER BOUND — and deliberately exposes no function that
 * computes "the fee" from a desired amount, because no such number exists before the mint.
 * A confirm screen discloses the RATE, says the fee applies to whatever is actually supplied,
 * and says the remainder comes back whole (FR-028).
 *
 * The quoted bps is passed straight back as `maxFeeBps` on submit, so a live rate above it
 * reverts rather than overcharging. Never synthesise a `maxFeeBps` here.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * CHAIN IDS. Bitcoin network ids are STRINGS (spec 061) and are out of scope for both
 * surfaces (FR-006), so every entry point runs the shared `assertEvmChainId` FIRST — the
 * same guard the bridge client uses, imported rather than re-rolled, so there is one
 * definition of "an EVM chain id" across spec 067. It throws rather than returning null on
 * purpose: `null` is this module's honest "unavailable" answer for a RUNTIME failure, and a
 * Bitcoin id arriving here is a caller bug, not a runtime failure.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
