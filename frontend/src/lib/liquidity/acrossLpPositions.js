/**
 * Across bridge-liquidity client (spec 067, T090).
 *
 * Everything a member needs to supply to, read, and exit an Across **bridge pool** — the
 * single-asset pot the bridge lends out to pay people instantly on other networks.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE ROUTER IS NEVER IN THIS PATH. That is a ruling, not an omission.
 *
 * `HubPool.addLiquidity(address l1Token, uint256 l1TokenAmount)` has **no recipient
 * parameter** — LP tokens mint to `msg.sender`. A fee-skimming wrapper would therefore
 * receive the LP tokens itself, making FairWins the custodian of the member's position and
 * leaving them unable to ever call `removeLiquidity`. That violates FR-023 (non-custodial)
 * and FR-021 (always exitable), so bridge-liquidity deposits are a **DIRECT member call**
 * and are **FEE-FREE in v1** (research R3 — the same rule spec 066 applied to delegated
 * staking: a fee is charged only where it can be charged atomically WITHOUT taking custody).
 *
 * Consequences this module is built to keep true:
 *   - nothing here imports, resolves, or targets `LiquidityRouter`. Every call it builds
 *     targets the HubPool or the supplied ERC-20, and nothing else;
 *   - there is no `maxFeeBps` argument and no fee-quoting function, because there is no fee.
 *     A bridge pool must show **no fee line at all** — not a line reading 0.00, which would
 *     imply a lever that does not exist;
 *   - a router pause, misconfiguration, or upgrade cannot stand between a member and their
 *     money. `LiquidityRouter` curates and lists bridge pools; it is not their path.
 *
 * `frontend/src/lib/liquidity/__tests__/acrossLpPositions.test.js` asserts all of the above
 * executably (T092).
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * BRIDGE LIQUIDITY IS ETHEREUM ONLY, AND SAYS SO.
 *
 * Across's HubPool is an L1 contract by design: the pot lives on Ethereum and the bridge
 * lends *from* it to every other network. Trading liquidity (Uniswap) is on all five
 * mainnets; bridge liquidity is on one (research R8). Every entry point here answers for a
 * network it does not serve with `bridgeLiquiditySupport(chainId)` — an explicit
 * `available: false` **and a reason naming where it IS available** — rather than returning
 * an empty list and letting the surface imply the feature merely has nothing in it. The
 * network list is derived from config, never hardcoded, so it stays true if Across ever
 * ships a second HubPool.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TWO READS THAT LOOK LIKE VIEWS AND ARE NOT.
 *
 * `exchangeRateCurrent` and `liquidityUtilizationCurrent` are **state-changing** on Across
 * (they settle accrued LP fees before answering), so `provider.call` on them requires an
 * explicit STATIC CALL — `contract.fn.staticCall(...)`. Calling them as plain reads would
 * either throw or, worse, be built as a transaction the member is asked to sign. Every read
 * below goes through `safeCall` and returns `null` when it fails: a member shown "0" when
 * the truth is "we could not read it" has been told something false about their own money
 * (FR-054). Nothing here ever substitutes a zero, a cached figure, or an invented one.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * ADDRESSES. `hubPool` is always an explicit argument, resolved by the caller from
 * `getHubPoolAddress(chainId)` (the network's own config record) or from the curated
 * `PoolListing.poolAddress` read off the router. Nothing here hardcodes one.
