/**
 * Address-screening SOURCES — every on-chain list the app can ask about an address, and where.
 *
 * Spec 021 amendment (issue #1458). The original screen asked ONE question — "does the FairWins
 * `SanctionsGuard` on the wallet's chain allow this address?" — and on the four mainnets where
 * FairWins has deployed no guard (Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Base) that question had no
 * answer, so every address there rendered as *Unscreened*. Meanwhile three public, free,
 * on-chain lists sat readable on those very chains. This registry names them.
 *
 * Three KINDS of source, each an honest fact a member can act on:
 *
 *   fairwins-guard     `SanctionsGuard.isAllowed` — the contract that will actually REFUSE a
 *                      wager/membership/pool action. Chainalysis oracle + the operator deny list,
 *                      fail-closed. Where it says no, the transaction reverts; that is the fact.
 *   chainalysis-oracle `isSanctioned` on the Chainalysis Sanctions Oracle — the OFAC SDN list,
 *                      published on-chain by Chainalysis and maintained by them. Read DIRECTLY so
 *                      the verdict is named to its author, on chains with and without a guard.
 *   issuer-freeze      `isBlacklisted` (Circle USDC) / `isBlackListed` (Tether USDT) — the
 *                      issuer's own freeze list. A frozen address cannot receive or move that
 *                      token: the transfer reverts. This is the "funds frozen" the issue is about,
 *                      and it is a DIFFERENT list from OFAC's (issuers freeze on court orders and
 *                      law-enforcement requests that never reach the SDN list).
 *
 * ── PROVENANCE OF THE TABLES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every address below was verified by a live read on 2026-09-06: `eth_getCode` non-empty, the
 * zero address answering `false`, and a known SDN-listed address (the Ronin-bridge exploiter,
 * `0x098B…2f96`) answering `true` on every row. A row is a CLAIM that the contract at that
 * address exposes that selector; a wrong row does not fabricate a verdict — the call reverts and
 * the source reports `unreadable` — but it would silently cost a member a source, so verify
 * before adding one. Chainalysis publishes the oracle addresses at
 * https://go.chainalysis.com/chainalysis-oracle-docs.html ; the Base deployment is at a
 * different address from the others.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   • No source on Ethereum Classic / Mordor beyond the guard: Chainalysis publishes no oracle
 *     there and no issuer-controlled stablecoin is in the platform's asset list. A chain with no
 *     source is REPORTED as uncovered, never counted as clear.
 *   • No off-chain risk provider (TRM, Chainalysis KYT, Elliptic). The `read(provider, account)`
 *     shape is what a BYO provider source would implement; it goes behind a member-held
 *     credential when it lands, not behind a FairWins key.
 *   • Nothing here is enforcement. The on-chain guard remains the only thing that blocks.
