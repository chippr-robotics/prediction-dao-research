/**
 * Reading the ESTATE — the platform's deployed state across every chain this build may read.
 *
 * Promoted here from `components/admin/liquidityAdminCommon.js` (spec 067), which had these
 * helpers for two admin tabs. Spec 071 generalizes them to the whole operations control plane,
 * so they belong in `lib/` — non-component callers (role sync, purchase preflight) use them too.
 *
 * The rules below are not conveniences; each one exists because its absence was, or would be, a
 * specific dishonesty.
 *
 *   1. **Scope is a NETWORK, not the wallet's network.** Control state is per-network and there
 *      are many. Gating an operator surface on the connected chain hides most of an estate from
 *      an operator who is simply connected somewhere else. Reads span the cohort; only WRITES
 *      require the wallet to be on the target chain.
 *
 *   2. **The cohort bounds everything.** `cohortChainIds()` — never `listSupportedChainIds()`,
 *      which spans both cohorts. Constitution III forbids reading across the testnet/mainnet
 *      boundary, and that is the mechanism.
 *
 *   3. **An unreadable read is never a zero.** Every read returns a three-state result
 *      (`chainReadResult.js`). One dead endpoint never fails a batch and never renders as 0.
 *
 *   4. **Authority is read from the contract that will enforce it**, never inferred from an
 *      app-wide role flag — see `readAuthority` for the defect that rule comes from.
 *
 * ── PROVIDERS: WHY THIS FILE DOES NOT TOUCH `NETWORKS[chainId].rpcUrl` ──────────────────────
 * The version of `readProviderFor` this replaces built its provider straight from
 * `NETWORKS[chainId].rpcUrl`. That bypasses `resolveRpcEndpoints`, so the member's configured
 * endpoint and its failover were ignored for every read those two admin tabs made — a live
 * spec-069 violation ("never hand-build a provider from NETWORKS[chainId].rpcUrl"). Generalizing
 * the helper to the rest of the console would have spread that bug across every operator view,
 * so it is fixed here: providers come from `getReadProvider(chainId)`, full stop.

 * transport then belongs to the browser wallet, whose RPC is whatever MetaMask/Brave happens to
 * be pointed at — typically a free pruned node. The admin membership scan on Polygon failed with
 *
 *   "History has been pruned for this block"
 *
 * for exactly that reason, and no amount of member RPC configuration could fix it, because the
 * configured endpoint was never consulted. A scan therefore always goes through
 * `getReadProvider`, which resolves the member's own endpoint + credential header + failover
 * (spec 069) — which is where an archival provider such as QuickNode is configured, and the only
 * place it CAN be configured: a credentialed URL in a `VITE_` variable ships in the public
 * bundle (spec 097).

 * Does `account` hold `roles` on THIS contract, on THIS chain?

 * ── WHY THE APP-WIDE ROLE FLAGS CANNOT ANSWER THIS ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * `useRoles()`'s `isAdmin` / `isGuardian` / … are one boolean each, resolved against a candidate
 * list on the WALLET's chain. Three separate things break:
 *
 *   • `isGuardian` means "holds GUARDIAN_ROLE on the WagerRegistry" — a different contract from
 *     the one a given view drives. The sets are unrelated, so an operator with the wager
 *     guardianship would be shown an enabled killswitch that reverts.
 *   • roles granted per-contract on purpose (LIQUIDITY_ADMIN on each router) collapse into one
 *     OR, showing an operator holding it on one contract every control on the other.
 *   • all of them read the wallet's chain, while views scope to a network the operator picks.
 *     A Polygon guardian whose wallet sits on Ethereum lost the Polygon controls.
 *
 * So authority is asked of the contract that will enforce it. The app-wide flags keep the job
 * they are good for: deciding whether a view appears at all.
 *
 * ── AND WHY AN UNREADABLE ANSWER IS NOT A DENIAL ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * `readable: false` means the question could not be put, not that the answer was no. Callers keep
 * offering the control and say authority is unconfirmed: the contract is the real gate and will
 * refuse anything the operator does not hold, whereas withdrawing a killswitch because an RPC
 * timed out tells an operator who DOES hold it that there isn't one.
 *
 * `deployed: false` IS a definite answer: there is no contract here to hold a role on.
