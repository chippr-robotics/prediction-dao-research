/**
 * Live per-venue operational state (spec 083, T018, FR-017 / FR-018).
 *
 * What a venue currently permits is a fact the VENUE owns, so it is read from the contract that
 * enforces it — Gains' `getTradingActivated()` — and never inferred from a FairWins config flag.
 * A venue that has quietly gone close-only would otherwise let the app offer an open that reverts
 * `Paused()` with the member's gas attached.
 *
 * FOUR RULES, each of which is a specific dishonesty when broken:
 *
 *   1. **An unreadable venue is `unreadable`, never assumed open.** Every failure path here fails
 *      CLOSED for opening. There is no branch that turns a dropped RPC call into "you may trade".
 *   2. **A venue that is not deployed on a chain is `not-deployed`, not `unreadable`.** These are
 *      different member-facing facts ("GMX is not on this network" vs "we could not reach it") and
 *      the repo already draws that line for estate reads (`lib/chains/chainReadResult.js`,
 *      spec 071). Both refuse opening, so nothing is loosened by telling the truth about which.
 *   3. **Per-venue isolation.** One venue's failure never blanks another: `readVenueStatuses`
 *      settles each reader independently, and the readers themselves are total — they return an
 *      `unreadable` result rather than throwing.
 *   4. **Status gates OPENING ONLY.** `exitAvailability()` returns a literal `offer: true` in every
 *      state, including `paused`, because nothing may stand between a member and closing or
 *      reducing a position they already hold (FR-014/FR-015/SC-004). `canClose()` answers the
 *      different question "will the venue accept this right now" — it is for the warning text, and
 *      a caller that uses it to HIDE an exit control has broken SC-004.
 *
 * PROVIDERS come from `utils/rpcProvider` so the member's own endpoint, headers and failover apply
 * (spec 069). Never hand-build one from `NETWORKS[chainId].rpcUrl` here.
 *
 * TOTALITY (the `lib/perps/format.js` convention): nothing in this module throws. These results
 * drive a disabled-with-a-reason control, and a throw would take the sheet down instead.
