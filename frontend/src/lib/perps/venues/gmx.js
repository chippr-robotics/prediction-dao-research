/**
 * GMX v2 calldata (spec 083, T014) — Arbitrum only.
 *
 * Every builder returns a `{ target, data, value }` call object, the shape `WalletContext.sendCalls`
 * consumes (the `lib/earn/vaultActions.js` convention that `venues/gains.js` also follows): a passkey
 * session authorizes approve + open with one ceremony, a classic wallet signs them in order.
 *
 * THE OWNERSHIP INVARIANT — and the one misreading that would create custody. GMX's
 * `CreateOrderParams.addresses.receiver` LOOKS like an owner field. It is not. Ownership is
 * `msg.sender` of `createOrder` (`ExchangeRouter.sol`: `address account = msg.sender;`), hashed into
 * the position key `keccak256(account, market, collateralToken, isLong)` — which is why
 * `positionKey()` below takes an account and not a receiver. `receiver` is a PAYOUT target and
 * `cancellationReceiver` is a REFUND target; both are the MEMBER here. `multicall` is
 * delegatecall-to-self, so batching cannot move the caller either. The ONLY FairWins address that
 * may appear anywhere in this calldata is `addresses.uiFeeReceiver`. Anyone tempted to put a
 * FairWins address in `receiver` "so the app can route proceeds" would be handing FairWins the
 * member's position; there is no version of that which is safe.
 *
 * An absent `uiFeeReceiver` is `address(0)` and NOT an error: GMX early-returns a zero UI fee for
 * the zero address, so an unconfigured receiver is structurally fee-free (fee-rails.md).
 *
 * THE APPROVAL TRAP. Collateral is pulled by `Router.pluginTransfer`, so the ERC-20 approval goes to
 * GMX's **Router**, never to the ExchangeRouter this module calls. Two different addresses, both
 * named "router" — see `buildApprovalCall`.
 *
 * SCALES. `sizeDeltaUsd`, `triggerPrice` and `acceptablePrice` are 1e30; collateral amounts are in
 * the collateral token's OWN decimals; `executionFee` is wei. Token amounts and fees are strictly
 * `bigint` — a JS number there is the tell of a human-unit value that would encode as dust.
 *
 * Builders THROW on malformed input rather than returning a sentinel: they run when a member is
 * about to sign, never during render, and a silently-wrong call object would reach the wallet with
 * the member's collateral attached. The decoders, the execution-fee estimate and its live read are
 * the opposite — they run over venue data inside effects and render, so they are total and return
 * null / []. `readExecutionFee` is the one asynchronous thing here and it is total too: no GMX on
 * this chain, no provider, a reverting call and a suspicious zero all resolve to `null`, and the
 * surface says the fee could not be read rather than guessing at money the member will pay.

 * EVERY GMX ORDER IS SETTLED BY A KEEPER THE MEMBER PAYS FOR. `createOrder` validates the declared
 * `executionFee` against GMX's own arithmetic at creation time
 * (`OrderUtils.createOrder` → `GasUtils.validateAndCapExecutionFee` → `validateExecutionFee`, which
 * reverts `InsufficientExecutionFee(minExecutionFee, executionFee)`), so a fee this app invents is
 * not a cosmetic number: too low and the member's signed close REVERTS or never runs; too high and
 * — see the buffer below — the surplus comes back.
 *
 * THE KEYS ARE READ FROM THE CHAIN, NOT TRANSCRIBED FROM A GUIDE. GMX's DataStore is a flat
 * `bytes32 → uint256` map, so the name is the only thing standing between a read and the wrong
 * number. Each constant below was derived as `keccak256(abi.encode("<NAME>"))` and `eth_call`ed
 * against the deployed Arbitrum DataStore 0xFD70de6b91282D8017aA4E741e9Ae325CAb992d8 on
 * **2026-08-12** (block 493,775,585). What it answered:

 *   INCREASE_ORDER_GAS_LIMIT             0x983e0a7f…  →           3,000,000
 *   DECREASE_ORDER_GAS_LIMIT             0xfce7a344…  →           3,000,000
