/**
 * What a GMX position is worth, worked out from GMX's own position read (spec 083, US1).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `Reader.getAccountPositions` returns `Position.Props` — `sizeInUsd` (1e30),
 * `sizeInTokens` (the INDEX token's own decimals), `collateralAmount` (the COLLATERAL token's own
 * decimals) and the side — and nothing else. It returns no entry price, no leverage, no P&L and no
 * mark price, so `usePerpsPositions` published all four as null and a member closing a leveraged
 * GMX position read six dashes in a row: entry, leverage, liquidation, P&L, proceeds and the
 * venue's fee. Three of those are not missing data at all — they are arithmetic over numbers the
 * venue DID report, once the scales are known.
 *
 * WHERE THE SCALES COME FROM — the pairs feed already on screen, not a new network read. The
 * gateway publishes each GMX market with its accepted collaterals, their decimals and GMX's own USD
 * price for them (`normalizeGmxPairs`), which is exactly what turns `collateralAmount` into money.
 * The INDEX token's decimals are not published as such, so they are read off the same list — see
 * `gmxIndexDecimals` for what that assumes and, more importantly, for when it refuses.
 *
 * FIVE RULES, and every one of them is about not inventing a number in front of a member's money:
 *
 *  1. **A DERIVED FIGURE IS NEVER PRESENTED AS THE VENUE'S.** Every row this module touches carries
 *     `derivedFields` naming exactly what FairWins worked out, and the surfaces label those (the
 *     sheet's "calculated" tag and its attribution sentence). The alternative — filling the same
 *     fields the gateway fills for Gains — would silently turn our arithmetic into GMX's own
 *     figures under the sentence "every figure above is as GMX reports it".
 *  2. **THE P&L IS NOT WHAT GMX WILL SETTLE AT.** It is size-in-tokens marked at the current price
 *     against the position's notional: it EXCLUDES accrued borrowing and funding (the accumulators
 *     are on the position, but the pool-side factors they are applied against are not read here)
 *     and the price impact of actually closing. Both surfaces say so.
 *  3. **ANY MISSING INPUT ⇒ null, NEVER A PARTIAL FIGURE.** No market match, no decimals, no price,
 *     a zero size — each leaves the field null and renders '—'. A wrong entry price on a leveraged
 *     position is worse than none.
 *  4. **THE LIQUIDATION PRICE IS NOT DERIVED AND MUST NOT BE.** It needs GMX's min-collateral
 *     factor and the accrued borrowing/funding, which this app does not read. It stays null and the
 *     sheet says specifically why, because that is the number a member expects most.
 *  5. **NOTHING HERE IS A GATE.** Pure functions over plain data — no network, no clock, no
 *     permission question. This module sits on the exit path (it is what a member reads before
 *     closing) and is classified there in `test/perps/safetyInvariants.test.js`.
