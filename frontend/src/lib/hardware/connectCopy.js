// Spec 085 follow-up — the words a member reads while connecting a device, DERIVED from the
// transport the adapter would actually open (adapters.js#ledgerTransportKind) rather than assumed.
//
// This exists because the copy was written for a desk: "Plug the device into this computer" is
// simply false on a phone pairing a Nano X over Bluetooth, and a member following it will conclude
// the feature is broken. Every hardware-connect string in the UI comes from here, so the guidance
// and the rail can never drift apart — a component that hardcodes a sentence is the bug this
// module prevents.
//
// It states copy only; it opens nothing and imports no vendor SDK.
