/**
 * Sanctions-screening reverts, decoded and put into words (#1292).
 *
 * `ISanctionsGuard`'s errors are NOT in the WagerRegistry ABI the frontend ships — the guard reverts
 * *through* the registry call, so solc never emits `SanctionedAddress` into the registry's own ABI and
 * ethers has nothing to decode it with. Every screened member therefore saw
 * "execution reverted (unknown custom error)" (or, worse, a fall-through telling them to check a
 * balance and an allowance that are both fine). Recovering the error from its selector is what makes
 * any `reason.includes('SanctionedAddress')` check able to fire at all.
 *
 * Shared because FOUR entrypoints are screened, not two: `createWager` and `acceptWager`
 * (contracts/wagers/WagerRegistryCore.sol `_createWager` / `_runAcceptGuard`) plus `createOpenWager`
 * (contracts/wagers/WagerRegistry.sol) and `acceptOpenWager`.
