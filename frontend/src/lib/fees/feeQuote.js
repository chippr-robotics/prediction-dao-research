/**
 * Platform-fee quotes for wrapper services (spec 060).
 *
 * The FeeRouter contract is the single on-chain source of truth for platform
 * fees; member surfaces quote the LIVE rate from it before any signature and
 * pass that quoted rate back as `maxFeeBps`, so a member can never be charged
 * more than the rate they were shown (FR-005). Networks with no router
 * deployed quote `{ available: false, bps: 0 }` — surfaces then behave exactly
 * as before the fee system existed (no fee, no fee line). A FAILED read on a
 * network that HAS a router is different: the caller must block the action
 * rather than proceed on a possibly-understated rate (FR-015).
 *
 * Spec 067 (T115) sharpens that second case rather than restating it. Three
 * things are true here and only here, so no surface has to re-derive them:
 *
 *   1. UNDEPLOYED AND UNREADABLE ARE DIFFERENT ANSWERS. "No router on this
 *      chain" is a fact — the action is honestly fee-free and proceeds. "A
 *      router is configured and we could not read it" is an ABSENCE of a fact,
 *      and the fee-bearing path stops (`FeeQuoteUnavailable`). Collapsing the
 *      second into the first would quote 0% for a rate that might be 2.5% —
 *      the exact dishonesty FR-051 forbids. Failing to read is never evidence
 *      of a lower rate.
 *
 *   2. A RATE IS ONLY USABLE IF IT PASSES ITS OWN CAP. `maxFeeBps` is the
 *      member's ceiling: it is the one number here that can cost them money if
 *      it is wrong. A decoded `feeBps` above the service's immutable `capBps`
 *      (or outside 0…10000) cannot have come from a healthy router, so it is
 *      treated as an unreadable rate and blocks, rather than being disclosed
 *      and then signed as a ceiling nobody vetted.
 *
 *   3. THE CEILING IS COMPUTED IN ONE PLACE. `maxFeeBpsFor` is the only way a
 *      quote becomes a `maxFeeBps` argument. A surface that reads `.bps`
 *      itself can drift into `?? 0` — a silently zero ceiling for a rate that
 *      was never read — so it is the helper that decides, and the helper
 *      throws where a zero would be a lie.
