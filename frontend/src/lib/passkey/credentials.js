/**
 * WebAuthn credential ceremonies for passkey accounts (spec 041, T016).
 *
 * Wraps the browser WebAuthn API (navigator.credentials) with:
 *  - capability detection (FR-004: the login surface offers passkeys only
 *    where genuinely usable, with an honest reason otherwise),
 *  - typed errors (contracts/passkey-connector.md error taxonomy),
 *  - PRF extension request at creation (feeds prfKeys.js, FR-012),
 *  - duplicate-signup steering (edge case: existing credential → sign-in).
 *
 * The private key NEVER leaves the platform authenticator; this module only
 * handles credential IDs, public keys, and assertion outputs.
 *
 * NATIVE CHANNELS (spec 102): on a native runtime the ceremonies run through
 * the platform credential bridge instead of `navigator.credentials` (the
 * embedded WebView is not a reliable WebAuthn citizen on either OS). The
 * selection lives HERE, in `resolveCredentialManager`, and the bridge is
 * credentials-shaped — every caller above this file is rail-blind, and the
 * relying party stays the tenant's web origin so the SAME passkey serves web
 * and native (FR-003).
