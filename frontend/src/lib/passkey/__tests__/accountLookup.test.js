/**
 * Spec 104 — the resolver's contract.

 * The refusing cases are the feature. A suite that asserts only "the owners include the key, so
 * we resolved" has not tested this module: what it exists to guarantee is a NEGATIVE — that an
 * address the chain did not confirm never reaches a session — and every regression this feature
 * prevents lives in one of the three non-`resolved` outcomes.
