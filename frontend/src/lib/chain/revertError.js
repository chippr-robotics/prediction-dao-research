/**
 * Decoding a custom error off a failed contract call (issue #1267).
 *
 * ethers v6 puts a DECODED custom error on `error.revert` only when it held the ABI at the point
 * the call failed — which is what happens on a `staticCall` through a JsonRpcProvider. On the
 * WRITE path through an injected EIP-1193 wallet the same revert arrives as raw selector bytes on
 * `error.data`, nested one or two levels down inside the RPC payload the wallet forwards, and
 * ethers never lifts it into `.revert`. A caller reading only `.revert` therefore renders
 * "execution reverted (unknown custom error)" for an error whose fragment its OWN ABI carries —
 * which is how the curator console lost the one sentence that distinguishes "your click did not
 * work" from "the package you reviewed is not the package on the registry any more".
 *
 * Decoding is a pure ABI operation: no chain, no provider, nothing to await. This module
 * deliberately does not import ethers — it takes an `Interface` the caller already has, so it
 * cannot become a second place that decides which ABI describes a given failure.
 */

/**
 * Every place a wallet or provider has been observed to leave the raw revert bytes.
 *
 * Ordered outermost-first: the shallowest copy is the one the immediate caller produced, and the
 * deeper ones are what a wallet forwarded from the node. A passkey UserOp failure nests one level
 * deeper than a signer transaction does; MetaMask nests the node payload under `data.data`.
