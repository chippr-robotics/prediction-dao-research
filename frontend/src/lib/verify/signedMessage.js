/**
 * The portable signed-message document (Protect ▸ Verify).
 *
 * A signature on its own proves nothing a verifier can check: EIP-191 recovery yields
 * *some* address, and an ERC-1271 signature (a passkey smart account, spec 041) does not
 * recover at all — it can only be checked by asking the account contract, on ONE chain.
 * So the thing a member hands to a counterparty is not the signature, it is this document:
 * the claim (address + chain), the exact message bytes, and the signature that binds them.
 *
 * Two rules the rest of the feature depends on:
 *
 * 1. **`scheme` is a HINT, never authority.** It records how the signature was produced so
 *    the verifier can try the likely path first. `verifyMessage` still tries both and
 *    reaches its own verdict — a document claiming `eip191` over ERC-1271 bytes verifies
 *    exactly as well (or as badly) as one labelled honestly.
 * 2. **The message is carried verbatim.** Whitespace, trailing newlines and Unicode are all
 *    signed bytes; normalizing any of them here would silently invalidate a good signature.
 *    JSON round-trips them exactly, which is why the transport is JSON rather than a
 *    hand-rolled block format.
