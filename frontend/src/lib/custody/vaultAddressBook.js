// Spec 068 — vaults live in the address book, so renaming and managing one happens in the same
// place as every other address a member keeps.
//
// The link is BY ADDRESS, not by a new field. `loadAddressBook` rebuilds each contact from a fixed
// field list, so any extra key (a `kind: 'vault'` marker, say) would be silently dropped on the next
// load — and the book is a spec-032 synced object, so a schema change also has to survive the merge
// on every device. Matching (address, chainId) against the member's own vault references needs
// neither, and there is exactly one name for a vault either way.
//
// Division of responsibility:
//   vaultReferences  — WHICH vaults are mine, on which chain, and my role. Custody's own record.
//   address book     — what the vault is CALLED. One rename path, shared with every other address.
