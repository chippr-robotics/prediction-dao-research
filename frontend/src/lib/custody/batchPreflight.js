// Issue #1368 — will this vault's guard let a MultiSend through?
//
// Every batch a vault proposes is a `MultiSendCallOnly` DELEGATECALL (`vaultTransaction.js#encodeMultiSend`
// sets operation 1). Both policy guards deny `operation != 0`:
//
//   SafePolicyGuardV2._preCheck   (contracts/custody/SafePolicyGuardV2.sol:432-452)
//   SafePolicyGuard._checkPolicy  (contracts/custody/SafePolicyGuard.sol:268-289)
//
// but each denies it ONLY once the vault has an active policy on that guard — V2 returns
// `exempt` when `_rules[safe].length == 0`, v1 when the vault has no allowlist, no cooldown and no
// configured assets. A vault holding the guard with nothing configured behaves exactly like an
// unguarded Safe, delegatecall included. "Is a guard set" is therefore the WRONG question, and
// answering it would refuse batches for vaults that would have executed them fine.
//
// The right question is asked of the guard itself: preview a delegatecall to the very
// MultiSendCallOnly address the proposal would carry. That read shares `_preCheck` / `_checkPolicy`
// verbatim with enforcement, so there is no client twin here to drift.
//
// THREE states, never two. A guard we could not read is `unknown` — on a money path callers treat
// that like a denial (propose the per-action shape, which every guard evaluates normally) but they
// must SAY "could not confirm", because an RPC timeout is not a policy.
