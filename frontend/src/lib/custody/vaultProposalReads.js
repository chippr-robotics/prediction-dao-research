// Spec 043 — shared, pure read of a vault's proposal state from chain + hub, used by both useVaultProposals
// (US2) and custodySource (US6). Reads owners/threshold/nonce, the verified hub proposals, per-owner
// approvals, and execution outcomes, then derives each proposal's status. Read-only; no React.
//
// Both event scans (the hub's proposals, and the Safe's own execution outcomes) go through
// `lib/chain/logScan`: bounded to the RPC's per-request block cap, resumable across calls, and cached
// for the session so a 30s poller re-reads only the new blocks. `complete` is false while a budgeted
// backfill is still catching up; a caller must disclose that rather than present the partial set as
// this vault's whole history.
