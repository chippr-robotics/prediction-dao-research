// Release 1.14.0 — starter policy templates for new vaults (spec 068 ordered engine).
//
// Why a template exists at all. Spec 049 shipped the policy step SKIPPABLE, and "skip" is what
// almost everyone picks, which leaves the most common vault shape — one owner, one key, no guard —
// strictly WORSE than a plain account while looking safer. The creation flow now offers a starter
// rule set by default, and refuses the 1-of-1-with-no-policy combination outright.
//
// Two constraints from the V2 engine shape this template, and both are easy to get wrong:
//
//   1. NO MATCHING RULE ⇒ DENIAL. A rule set that names only specific assets silently bricks
//      everything else the vault might ever do. The template therefore always ends with a
//      catch-all `ANY_ASSET` rule, so nothing a member expects to work is refused by accident.
//   2. A WINDOW LIMIT NEEDS A SPECIFIC ASSET (validateRulesConfig): an any-asset 24-hour counter
//      would sum raw base units across assets and mean nothing. The capped rule therefore names
//      the chain's stable token, whose units are the one denomination that means the same thing on
//      every chain — unlike the native coin, where "1" is ~$0.40 on Polygon and ~$3,000 on
//      Ethereum, so no cross-chain default amount could be honest.
//
// The delay is the part that protects a SINGLE-owner vault. Approvals cannot: with one owner the
// guard's approver requirement is exactly the Safe threshold, so it adds nothing. A cooldown does
// something the threshold cannot — it rate-limits a key that has already been stolen, so a drain
// becomes a series of spaced, visible transactions rather than one.
//
// Amounts here are DEFAULTS, not policy: both knobs are member-editable in the wizard and the
// summary shown before signing is rendered from the encoded rules, never from this file's prose.
