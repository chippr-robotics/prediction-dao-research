/**
 * Mini-app package integrity (spec 073, research R3 · FR-011).
 *
 * This module is the only place in the host that decides whether bytes fetched
 * from a gateway are the bytes a curator approved. Everything the platform
 * promises about supply-chain safety reduces to the two comparisons below:
 *
 *   1. `keccak256(manifest.json bytes) === registry.approved.manifestHash`
 *   2. `sha256(file bytes) === manifest.files[path].sha256`  (for every executed file)
 *
 * Three deliberate properties, each of which is a hole if reversed:
 *
 * - **Bytes, never objects.** Every verify function takes the raw bytes as they
 *   came off the wire. Accepting a parsed manifest and re-serializing it before
 *   hashing would compare *our* JSON encoding against the chain's, so a package
 *   whose bytes differ from the approved ones (whitespace, key order, a trailing
 *   field our parser dropped) would verify anyway. Passing a `string` is refused
 *   for the same reason — a decode/encode round trip is not the identity.
 * - **Normalize before compare.** Digests arrive from three encodings (Solidity
 *   `bytes32` via ethers, lowercase hex in the manifest, whatever a hand-edited
 *   record contains). Both sides are put through the same normalizer, so a
 *   mismatch is a real mismatch and `0X…`/`0x…`/uppercase can neither pass nor
 *   fail spuriously.
 * - **An unusable expected value is a refusal, not a pass.** If the digest we
 *   are supposed to compare against is malformed, verification fails closed.
 *   "No expected value ⇒ accept" is how integrity checks quietly stop existing.
 *
 * Pure module: no IO, no React, no network. The gateway is untrusted by
 * construction — CID validity is a cheap pre-check elsewhere, never the
 * integrity boundary.
