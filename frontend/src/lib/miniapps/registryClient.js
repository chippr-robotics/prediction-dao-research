/**
 * MiniAppRegistry read client (spec 073) — the only path from the app to the mini-app catalog.
 *
 * Everything the host eventually EXECUTES is decided by what this module reports: which listings
 * exist, which are Approved, and which on-chain `(cid, manifestHash)` tuple the loader is allowed to
 * fetch and verify (FR-010/FR-011). That makes this a trust boundary rather than a data-access
 * convenience, and three rules follow from it.
 *
 * 1. **ABSENCE AND FAILURE ARE DIFFERENT ANSWERS, AND NEITHER OF THEM IS AN EMPTY CATALOG.**
 *    `{ status: 'not-deployed' }` is a FACT about this build: no registry address is configured for
 *    the cohort's registry chain, so there is no catalog to have an opinion about. `{ status:
 *    'unreachable' }` is the ABSENCE of a fact: a registry exists and we could not read it. Those
 *    lead to different copy and different affordances, so they are different outcomes — the
 *    `fetchFeeQuote` distinction (spec 060/067), applied to listings instead of rates.
 *
 *    Collapsing either into `apps: []` would be a lie with teeth: an empty catalog reads to a member
 *    as "nothing is approved", so an RPC outage would render exactly like a curator having suspended
 *    every app — and a *single* unreadable page would render exactly like one app having been
 *    suspended. So no failure path in this module ever produces an `apps` array at all, and a
 *    partial page read fails the WHOLE catalog rather than presenting a subset as the complete
 *    curated list (spec.md edge case: "states it cannot verify listings", never stale-as-verified).
 *
 * 2. **THE CACHE NEVER DECIDES WHAT EXECUTES.** `fetchCatalog` memoises its result so browsing does
 *    not re-page the registry on every keystroke, and stamps `fetchedAt` so a surface can disclose
 *    how old the list is. The launch path does not use it: `fetchApp` always re-reads the single
 *    record it is about to run (FR-010), because the window this closes is precisely the one a
 *    curator uses — suspending a compromised app between a member opening the catalog and clicking
 *    Launch. A cached snapshot is offered on failure only under the `stale` key, never as `apps`, so
 *    no caller can render it as verified by accident.
 *
 * 3. **ONE CHAIN, RESOLVED HERE.** The registry lives on the cohort's single reference chain
 *    (`miniAppChainId()`, FR-025) and is read through `getReadProvider` so the member's own RPC
 *    route applies (spec 069). Callers never pass a chain id or a provider: a mini-app catalog read
 *    against the wrong chain would approve packages under an authority this build must not trust.

/**
 * The per-app namespace key: the identity used for the mini-app's private store
 * (FR-018) and for its audit attribution (FR-019).
 *
 * THIS IS NOT THE SLUG, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. A slug is derived from the
 * registry NAME, and a name is neither immutable nor globally unique:
 *
 *  - a vendor can rename a listing (`updateMetadata`), and a rename must not
 *    orphan the member's saved state or split one app's audit trail in two;
 *  - the same name is registrable on every chain the registry is deployed to,
 *    so a name-keyed namespace would let a Mordor listing read and overwrite the
 *    state of the Polygon listing that happens to share its name — and the
 *    backup this store rides on (`miniAppState`) is deliberately NOT
 *    network-scoped, so nothing downstream would separate them either;
 *  - a slug is what a PACKAGE claims about itself in `manifest.id`, and while
 *    the launch binding now forces that claim to match the record, keying
 *    storage on the immutable side of the check means a bug in the check can
 *    never become a cross-app data leak.
 *
 * The numeric registry id is allocated by the contract, never reused and never
 * editable by anyone; pairing it with the registry chain id makes it unique
 * across every network this build can read. `app-<chainId>-<registryId>` is the
 * result, shaped to satisfy {@link APP_ID_PATTERN} because `createAppStore`
 * refuses any id it cannot guarantee isolation for — a leading letter is
 * required, so the numeric key carries the `app-` prefix rather than starting
 * with a digit.
 *
 * @param {number} chainId - the registry chain the record was read from
 * @param {number} registryId - the record's on-chain `id` (allocated from 1)
 * @returns {string|null} the namespace key, or null when either input is not a
 *   positive integer (a caller with no record has no namespace to open)

/**
 * Resolve a URL slug to its record — the launch read behind `/apps/:slug`.
 *
 * Goes through {@link fetchApp}, so this IS an FR-010 launch read: it never
 * consults the catalog memo, and the record it returns is the record the caller
 * is about to run.
 *
 * Two properties matter beyond the plumbing:
 *
 * 1. **The slug is normalized before it reaches the chain.** A member's link may
 *    carry any casing (`/apps/Token-Mint`), and the registry's `idByName`
 *    applies the contract's own folding — so the string handed over must already
 *    be the shape that folding expects.
 * 2. **The record is verified to answer to the slug that asked for it.** After
 *    resolving, `appSlug(record.name)` must equal the requested slug. This
 *    client and the contract normalize independently; if they ever disagreed,
 *    the honest outcome is "no such app", never "here is a different app than
 *    the URL named". A record that fails this check is skipped, not returned.
