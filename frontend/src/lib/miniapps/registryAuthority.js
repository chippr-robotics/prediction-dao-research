/**
 * Curator authority on the MiniAppRegistry (spec 073 T037 · FR-004, FR-022).
 *
 * The registry is the platform's supply-chain trust boundary: whoever holds
 * `APP_CURATOR_ROLE` decides which packages a member's browser is allowed to
 * execute. This module answers exactly one question — does THIS account hold
 * that role on THAT registry — and it asks the registry itself.
 *
 * ── WHY NOT THE APP-WIDE ROLE FLAGS ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * `useRoles()`'s booleans are resolved against the WagerRegistry / MembershipManager
 * role sets. `APP_CURATOR_ROLE` lives on neither, and — critically — it
 * **administers itself** (`_setRoleAdmin(APP_CURATOR_ROLE, APP_CURATOR_ROLE)`),
 * so the platform administrator cannot grant it and holding `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`
 * says nothing about holding it. Deriving curation from an admin flag would make
 * the separation the contract goes out of its way to create purely decorative in
 * the one place a human acts on it. This is the spec-067 `readRouterAuthority`
 * precedent — per-contract authority, asked of the contract that will enforce it
 * — applied to a role whose whole point is that no other role implies it.
 *
 * ── WHY THE OUTCOME IS DISCRIMINATED ────────────────────────────────────────
 * "You do not hold the curator role" and "we could not ask" are different
 * sentences, and only one of them is about the operator's grant. The console
 * already preserves that distinction at its front door (AdminPanel's "Could Not
 * Verify Access" vs "Access Restricted"), and a curation surface that collapsed
 * it would tell a curator during an RPC outage that their multisig grant had not
 * landed — sending them to look for a permissions problem that does not exist.
 * So there are five outcomes, not a boolean:
 *
 *   `not-deployed`  this build has no registry address on the registry chain
 *   `no-account`    nothing is connected, so there is nobody to ask about
 *   `unverified`    a registry exists and we could not read it (route or call failed)
 *   `held` / `not-held`  the registry answered
 *
 * `held` is true ONLY for the definite yes. A caller that reads `.held` and
 * nothing else fails closed on every uncertainty, which is the right default for
 * a write control; a caller that wants to be honest about WHY reads `.status`.
 *
 * ── WHY `getRoleAdmin` IS HERE TOO ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * The self-administration is the mechanism behind the guarantee, and a panel
 * that states it should be stating something it checked rather than something it
 * was told at design time. A deployment that came up without it (a hand-rolled
 * proxy init, a future migration) would still gate writes correctly and would
 * still be materially different from the documented design — so the panel reads
 * the admin role and says which of the two it is looking at.
