/**
 * The host's shared-module scope (spec 073, research R2 ·
 * `contracts/host-context.md`).
 *
 * A mini-app package ships NO copy of React, ReactDOM or ethers. The build
 * preset (`tools/miniapp-build/hostScopePlugin.js`) rewrites those bare imports
 * into shims that read their bindings from
 * `globalThis[Symbol.for('fairwins.miniapp.host')]` at module-evaluation time.
 * This module is the other half of that contract: it puts the host's own
 * singleton namespaces there, once, before anything can be mounted.
 *
 * That is a correctness requirement before it is a size optimization — two
 * copies of React cannot share one element tree, so a mini-app that bundled its
 * own React could not render inside the host's workspace at all. The scope is
 * also how the SDK reaches an app: `@fairwins/miniapp-sdk` has no
 * implementation on disk, because the host IS the implementation.
 *
 * Three properties are load-bearing, and each is enforced rather than assumed:
 *
 * - **A registered symbol.** A Blob-imported mini-app is a different module
 *   graph from the host, so a module-local symbol could never be shared between
 *   them. `Symbol.for` is the same key in both graphs and is namespaced enough
 *   that nothing else on the page will collide with it.
 * - **Installed once and not re-pointable.** The property is defined
 *   non-writable and non-configurable, and a second `installHostScope()` returns
 *   the existing scope instead of replacing it. Otherwise the first mini-app to
 *   run could swap the scope out from under every app loaded after it —
 *   substituting its own "React" for the host's is precisely the attack the
 *   frozen scope exists to prevent.
 * - **Exactly the documented surface.** The scope is checked against
 *   {@link HOST_SHARED_MODULES} at install: a missing specifier would surface as
 *   an unattributable crash inside an app's own code, and an EXTRA one would be
 *   a privileged module handed to third-party code that nothing in the manifest
 *   ever declared (FR-013 — anything not listed is unreachable by design).
 *
 * BUILD-SIDE TWIN: `tools/miniapp-build/constants.js` declares the same symbol
 * key, host API version and shared-module list for the packaging preset. The
 * two are a matched pair across the build/host boundary (the preset is Node
 * tooling, not a frontend dependency) and MUST change together — a drift means
 * a package that builds cleanly and gets `undefined` at runtime. The gating
 * test is `src/test/miniapps/hostScope.test.js`.
