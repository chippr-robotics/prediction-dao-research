/**
 * Bridge status machine + cross-session reconciler (spec 067, US1 — T072/T073/T074).
 *
 * This is the honesty-critical half of the Bridge surface. `acrossQuotes.js` decides what a
 * transfer will cost; this file decides what a member is TOLD about a transfer that is already
 * moving, and it is the only place allowed to promote one to a finished state.
 *
 * The machine is exactly the one in data-model.md:
 *
 *   submitted ──src mined──> source_confirmed ──indexed──> in_flight ──dst fill──> delivered
 *       │                                                      │                   (SETTLED)
 *       │ src revert                                           ├── expiry refund ──> refunded
 *       └──────────> FAILED                                    │                    (CANCELLED)
 *                                                              └── past expectedBy ─> needs_attention
 *                                                                                     (still PENDING)
 *
 * Three rules are load-bearing and every branch below exists to keep one of them:
 *
 *   1. FR-009 — `delivered` is reachable ONLY from confirmed DESTINATION-side evidence: a fill
 *      transaction hash on the destination network. Not an upstream string that says "filled", not
 *      an elapsed timer, not an origin receipt. `deriveBridgeState` will not name that state
 *      without a hash, and `captureBridgeState` refuses to persist it without one either — two
 *      independent gates, because a false completion is the single worst thing this feature can do.
 *      The same evidence rule applies to `refunded`: money coming back is also a claim about money.
 *
 *   2. FR-011 — `needs_attention` is NOT terminal. It is a statement about the clock, not about the
 *      outcome, so a transfer sitting in it can still resolve to `delivered` or `refunded` on a
 *      later poll. It exists so a late transfer says what is known and what the recourse is
 *      (`BRIDGE_NEEDS_ATTENTION_RECOURSE`) instead of spinning forever.
 *
 *   3. FR-010 / FR-053 — an in-flight bridge survives the app closing. Nothing here holds state:
 *      the entry lives in the client ledger store (`sources/bridgeLedgerSource.js`), which is
 *      per-account, persisted, and carried in the spec-032 encrypted backup. On load,
 *      `reconcileBridges` re-derives the truth from evidence. The gateway status endpoint is a
 *      CONVENIENCE, not the authority — when it is unset, killswitched or unreachable the reconciler
 *      falls back to reading the chain (the origin receipt plus a destination fill log), and if even
 *      that is unavailable the clock still runs. A gateway outage can therefore never strand an
 *      already-submitted transfer; it can only make the app know less, and it says so.
 *
 * Everything unknown is reported as unknown. There is no branch in this file that invents progress,
 * and every failure to observe resolves toward the *lower* claim (research R7, FR-054).

 * Notifications (T111, FR-037) — telling a member about a transfer they are not watching.
 *
 * A bridge is the one FairWins action a member routinely walks away from: it spans two networks and
 * usually finishes minutes later, on a screen they closed. So the three outcomes that change what
 * they know — it arrived, it came back, it is late — are announced.
 *
 * Three rules, each a direct consequence of a rule already enforced above:
 *
 *   1. **The same evidence gate.** `delivered` is announced only with a destination fill hash and
 *      `refunded` only with a returning-transaction hash. `deriveBridgeState` already refuses to
 *      name those states without them, so this is the third independent gate on the same claim —
 *      deliberately, because a false "arrived" push is the worst thing this feature can emit.
 *   2. **One notification per transition.** The emitter runs only when a new state was actually
 *      APPLIED to the ledger, and the ledger will not re-apply a state it already holds, so a
 *      re-poll (or a second poller) cannot produce a duplicate.
 *   3. **Say what is needed.** Every message ends with the action, including when the action is
 *      nothing. `needs_attention` is the only one that asks for anything, and what it asks for is
 *      checking — never "contact support about your missing money", which would be untrue.
