/**
 * BridgeRouter read + bridge-call layer (spec 067).
 *
 * The Bridge surface reads its on-chain control surface at runtime: which routes are
 * curated, their per-transaction limits, the Across SpokePool in use, and the
 * per-network pause flag (FR-051). When the router is undeployed or unreadable this
 * returns `null` and the caller shows an honest unavailable state
 * (`BRIDGE_UNAVAILABLE.router` in `lib/bridge/bridgeCopy.js`) — availability is
 * withheld, never invented (FR-054). That mirrors `lib/staking/stakingRouter.js`
 * deliberately: same shape, same null-on-failure contract, same "the caller decides
 * the fallback" split.
 *
 * The fee-bearing path is gated separately by `fetchFeeQuote`
 * (`FEE_SERVICES.BRIDGE_TRANSFER`). The rate the member was shown is passed straight
 * back as `maxFeeBps` on submit, so a live rate above it reverts rather than
 * overcharging (FR-028). Never synthesise a `maxFeeBps` here.
 *
 * It also builds the `bridgeWithFee` call as `{ target, data, value }` entries for the
 * spec-041 unified send rail: an ERC-20 route approves the router then calls; a native
 * route has no approve leg and carries `inputAmount` as `value` (Across wraps the
 * native value itself).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * CHAIN IDS. Bitcoin network ids are STRINGS (spec 061) and bridging excludes Bitcoin
 * outright (FR-006). Every entry point here therefore runs `assertEvmChainId` FIRST,
 * so a string id can never reach `getContractAddressForChain` (which would index
 * `NETWORK_CONTRACTS['bitcoin']` and quietly return `undefined`) or wagmi (which would
 * treat it as an unknown chain). The assertion throws rather than returning null on
 * purpose: `null` is this module's honest "unavailable" answer for a *runtime* failure,
 * and a Bitcoin id arriving here is not a runtime failure, it is a caller bug. Surfaces
 * exclude Bitcoin upstream via `isBitcoinNetworkId` / `bridgeUnavailableCopy`.
