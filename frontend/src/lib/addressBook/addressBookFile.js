/**
 * Address Book export/import file (Spec 021 US5; amended for issue #1550).
 *
 * The export is PLAIN JSON. No encryption, no signature, no wallet.
 *
 * Two reasons. First, the old design derived a symmetric key from an ethers
 * `signer.signMessage(...)`, and `WalletContext` nulls the ethers signer for a
 * passkey session — so BOTH buttons threw 'Wallet not connected' at a member who
 * was plainly signed in, with their book on screen. Second, a readable file is
 * the point besides: a member is meant to be able to open the export, read it,
 * and hand it to somebody else.
 *
 * THE FILE IS NOT SECRET. It carries nicknames, addresses and notes in the
 * clear. Every surface that produces one MUST say so before the download, and
 * the file says so about itself in its own `note` field so the fact survives
 * leaving the app.
 *
 * This is scoped to the manual export file ONLY. The address book is also a
 * spec-032 synced object (`lib/backup/syncedObjects.js`), and THAT channel stays
 * encrypted — do not "consistently" de-encrypt it.
 *
 * Files written before this change are ChaCha20-Poly1305 envelopes keyed on a
 * wallet signature. They still open, but only where a signer exists. Where one
 * does not, the refusal names THAT as the reason: it must never say "wrong
 * wallet", which is a different fact and on a passkey session was never true.
