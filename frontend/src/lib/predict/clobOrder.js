/**
 * Predict trade cost math (spec 057). The ORDER itself (EIP-712 struct, amount rounding, salt, signature,
 * submission) is built and signed by the official @polymarket/clob-client (see clobSession.js) — hand-rolling
 * it produced the wrong struct (the CTF Exchange Order is 12 fields, domain version "1", and attribution is
 * NOT a signed field). This module keeps ONLY the honest cost breakdown the confirm UI shows before signing:
 * the notional and — crucially — FairWins' ADDITIVE builder fee as its own labelled line (FR-011/FR-012).
 *
 * Polymarket's OWN taker fee is charged by their engine at execution (a curve over price/size); we do NOT
 * fabricate a dollar estimate for it — it's disclosed honestly as a separate note in the confirm UI. Makers
 * pay no builder fee.
