 * `/ipfs/<cid>/<path>` names bytes by their own hash, so the bytes behind a
 * given URL can never change. A new app version is a new CID, which is a new
 * URL, which is a cache miss — the staleness risk that keeps the rest of this
 * worker network-first simply does not exist here.
 *
 * THIS CACHE IS NOT A TRUST BOUNDARY. The loader re-verifies every byte it gets
 * — manifest keccak against the on-chain hash, then per-file sha256 — AFTER the
 * response is handed over, cached or not. So a poisoned or corrupted cache
 * entry cannot execute; it fails the same integrity check a poisoned gateway
 * response would (FR-011). Nor can the cache resurrect a suspended app: launch
 * re-reads the registry first, and status is decided on-chain, never here
 * (FR-010).
