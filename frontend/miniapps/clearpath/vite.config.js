 * on, in parallel, independent of where the wallet sits. That is why it declares `network` (for
 * the chain roster and per-chain descriptors) and why `wallet:submit` alone is not enough — a
 * member viewing a DAO on another chain has to be able to move their wallet there.

 * the workspace and any release tooling read. A literal here made those two
 * numbers independent — bumping the workspace version would change no published
 * byte, and bumping this literal would change the on-chain commitment with no
 * `package.json` change to show for it. They agreed only by coincidence.
 *
 * Read at config-evaluation time rather than imported, so no bundler behaviour
