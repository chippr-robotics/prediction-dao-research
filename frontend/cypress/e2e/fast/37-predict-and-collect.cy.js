// 37-predict-and-collect.cy.js
// Fast-tier E2E for Predict and Collect (specs 057 / 055 / 056 / 013).
//
// Issue #1239. Both features are a frontend section plus a relay-gateway proxy —
// NO contract changes, no custody, the member's wallet is the only order signer.
// So everything short of the signature is answerable at the gateway boundary and
// belongs in the no-chain tier.
//
// Both gate on the SAME variable, `VITE_RELAYER_URL`: unset, their tabs hide
// entirely and none of this is reachable. The tier's dev server (`dev:fast`)
// points it at a port nothing serves, so a spec that wants these surfaces stubs
// the gateway itself and a spec that does not sees the honest unreachable state.
//
// The divergence worth remembering: Collect's OpenSea referral costs the member
// NOTHING, while Predict's builder fee is ADDITIVE — a real taker cost — and must
// be disclosed as its own line, never hidden and never called free.
// =============================================================================
