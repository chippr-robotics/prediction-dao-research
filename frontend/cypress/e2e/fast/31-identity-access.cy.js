// Fast-tier E2E tests for endpoints, callsigns and compliance gating
// (specs 069 + 054 + 007).
//
// Issue #1241. Every flow here is decided on the member's own device, or by a
// single contract READ that changes what they are shown: an endpoint saved to
// device-scoped preferences, a credential redacted before it reaches the DOM, a
// tier gate, a screening verdict. None of it moves value, so admission rule 1
// puts all of it in the no-chain tier, and the reads are answered at the RPC
// boundary using the app's OWN ABI fragments.
//
// SPLIT FROM THE VERIFY SPEC DELIBERATELY. Seven heavy tests in one file killed
// the browser mid-run — a reproducible ECONNRESET after the fifth — and the fast
// tier is already over its per-leg budget (#1249). Two focused specs also shard
// better than one long one.
