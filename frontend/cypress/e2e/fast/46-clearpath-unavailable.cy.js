// 46-clearpath-unavailable.cy.js
// No-chain E2E for ClearPath's Launch tab where a DAO CANNOT be created
// (spec 030 pillar A, the 2026-08-30 amendment on issue #1268; issue #1400 §A).
//
//   CDU-01  miniapp.clearpath-create-dao-unavailable — pre-Cancun (permanent)
//   CDU-02  miniapp.clearpath-create-dao-unavailable — not deployed (a state)
//
// ── WHY THIS IS IN THE NO-CHAIN TIER ────────────────────────────────────────
// Admission rule 1: this is disclosure copy and a withheld control. Nothing
// signs, nothing settles, and the decision under test — `canCreate` is false, so
// say WHICH of the two reasons it is — is made entirely from what the host told
// the package about the estate. Spending an on-chain shard on it would spend the
// merge gate's wall clock proving that a button is absent.
//
// ── WHAT THIS FLOW IS ACTUALLY DEFENDING ────────────────────────────────────
// The two reasons are NOT the same fact, and collapsing them is the regression
// that would never fail a unit test of the surrounding app:
//
//   "This chain runs a pre-Cancun EVM" is PERMANENT. OpenZeppelin 5.4.0's
//   `Governor` uses `mcopy`, ETC 61 and Mordor 63 do not have it, and the
//   maintainer's decision on #1268 is an exclusion, not a deferral. An ETC
//   member told only "not available" waits for a rollout that is never coming.
//
//   "The factory is not deployed there" is a state of the estate that changes
//   the day somebody runs `deploy-clearpath.js` against that chain.
//
// Both branches must also withhold the control rather than disable it: a greyed
// "Launch DAO" with no explanation is exactly the failure this replaces.
//
// ── WHAT IS STUBBED ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The registry READ (over Polygon's RPC, the mainnet build's `miniAppChainId()`)
// and the IPFS gateway TRANSPORT. The bytes are the REAL ClearPath package as
// `npm run build --workspace @fairwins/miniapp-clearpath` produced them, and the
// loader still takes keccak256 of the manifest and compares it to the hash the
// (stubbed) registry holds, then sha256 of every file it executes — so what runs
// here is the shipped package, verified by the shipped pipeline.
//
// ── THE ONE THING THIS SPEC NEEDS FROM CI ───────────────────────────────────
// `frontend/miniapps/clearpath/dist/` must exist. The on-chain tier gets it from
// `setup:e2e`'s `publish:local:miniapps`; this tier installs only the frontend
// workspace and builds nothing, so the fast job needs one build step (~0.3s).
// The `miniappRealPackage` task says so in as many words when it is missing,
// rather than failing on a selector.
// =============================================================================
