/**
 * E2E Tests: Platform fees (spec 060, Full-tier)
 *
 * The invariant this tier exists for is not "a fee exists" — it is **a member is never charged
 * above the rate they were shown**. Disclosure, signature and settlement are three different
 * layers, and only a flow test spans them: the rate is READ from the FeeRouter and RENDERED, the
 * rendered rate is passed back as `maxFeeBps` when the member signs, and the amount actually
 * taken lands in the treasury on chain. Each of the three assertions below is derived from the
 * PREVIOUS layer — the expected fee is computed from the percentage the DOM showed, never from
 * the number the test arranged, so a UI that disclosed one rate and signed another fails here.
 *
 * Requires (all from `npm run setup:e2e`):
 *   · the `FeeRouter` from `deploy:local:fees` — the real spec-060 contract, not a double;
 *   · a `MockERC4626Vault` from `deploy:local:earn-vault` — `depositToVaultWithFee` is the ONE
 *     on-chain charge path and Earn ▸ Lend is its only member surface, so a local chain needs
 *     something for the wrapper to wrap.
 *
 * The vault LIST is stubbed at Morpho's public API (there is no Morpho on a local chain) — the
 * same treatment `cy.interceptIpfs()` gives Pinata elsewhere in this tier. Everything that
 * decides money is real: the router, the vault, the token, the rate, the signature and the
 * balances all live on the chain, and every outcome below is read back from it.
 *
 * Closes #1233 (sub-issue of #1228). Flows:
 *   FEE-01 fees.disclosed-before-signature — the rate on screen is the rate charged
 *   FEE-02 fees.disclosed-before-signature — a raise after the quote CANNOT overcharge the member
 *   FEE-03 fees.admin-changes-rate         — an operator edits a rate and members see the new one
 *
 * Checklist: FEE-01..FEE-03
