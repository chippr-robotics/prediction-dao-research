/**
 * E2E Tests: settling a group payment (spec 058 group-pay amendment, Full-tier)
 *
 * The no-chain half of group pay already exists (`fast/41-group-pay.cy.js`): how a recipient list
 * is built, which recipients are refused and with what reason, and what the confirm screen
 * discloses BEFORE anything is signed. Nothing in that file signs or moves value, and it says so.
 *
 * THIS is the settlement half — the member presses the button and their own money leaves. That is
 * admission rule 2 of `docs/developer-guide/e2e-testing-policy.md` (a member signing something
 * that costs them money MUST have on-chain coverage), so every claim below is judged on CHAIN
 * STATE: recipient balances read back from the node, and the vault's own nonce and proposal queue
 * read back from the Safe and the hub. Not one assertion here is satisfied by a dialog's wording.
 *
 *   GS-01  the sequential rail   — N separate sends, per-recipient outcomes, one leg FAILS alone
 *   GS-02  the vault batch rail  — ONE MultiSend proposal, executed once, pays everybody
 *   GS-03  the vault split rail  — a policy that denies batches ⇒ N proposals at CONSECUTIVE nonces
 *
 * ── WHY THERE IS NO GS-04 (the passkey batched rail) ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * `useGroupPay` (frontend/src/hooks/useGroupPay.js:267-300) sends a passkey group payment as ONE
 * `sendCalls` batch (the call itself is line 294). That lands in `sendPasskeyBatch`, which
 * reaches the chain ONLY through
 * `bundlerClient.sendUserOperation` (frontend/src/lib/passkey/sendBatch.js:126) after
 * `chooseRoute` (frontend/src/lib/passkey/submission.js:61-82) has found either a healthy relayer
 * or a healthy BUNDLER — and the one route it will take optimistically still requires
 * `bundlerUrls.length > 0` (sendBatch.js:83). The "never-stranded self-funded fallback" at
 * sendBatch.js:118-136 is about PAYMASTER SPONSORSHIP, not about bypassing the bundler: it rebuilds
 * the same UserOp without a paymaster and submits it to the same bundler. So there is no
 * self-submitted batch, and this rail cannot be exercised on the ordinary on-chain tier, which
 * runs a bare hardhat node and no ERC-4337 stack. It needs the PASSKEY_FULL_STACK harness that was
 * never built (#1271), and the matrix row says so rather than this file skipping a test that
 * would look like coverage. The whole spec is deliberately NOT gated on that flag — the three
 * rails above are reachable today and are where the money actually moves for classic and vault
 * members.
 *
 * ── WHAT MAKES A LEG FAIL, AND WHY IT IS THAT ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * GS-01 needs one recipient that genuinely cannot be paid while the others genuinely can, and the
 * form refuses to preview at all for the two obvious candidates: a sanctioned address is BLOCKING
 * before submit (`validateRecipients`, frontend/src/lib/payments/groupPay.js:187-193) and so is a
 * list whose total exceeds the balance (groupPay.js:227-228). So the failing recipient is the
 * local stablecoin's own CONTRACT — a plausible paste, a real member mistake, and an ERC-20 with
 * no `receive`/`fallback` (contracts/mocks/MockERC20.sol), so a plain coin transfer to it reverts
 * in `eth_estimateGas`. The mock provider surfaces that as a rejection rather than swallowing it
 * (cypress/support/commands.js:127-131), which is exactly the per-recipient failure the sequential
 * rail promises to survive.
 *
 * Checklist: GS-01..GS-03
