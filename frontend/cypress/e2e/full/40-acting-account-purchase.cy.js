/**
 * E2E Tests: a membership purchase lands on the ACTING account (spec 098, Full-tier)
 *
 * Flow: purchase.acting-account —
 *   "A member operating as another account purchases membership that lands on the acting
 *    account, on every submit rail — including the split approve/purchase proposals on a
 *    policy-guarded vault."
 *
 * ── WHY THIS TIER (admission rule 2) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `MembershipManager.purchaseTier` credits `msg.sender` and takes no beneficiary, so the whole
 * feature is the claim that the account which SIGNS is the account the modal names. That claim
 * only exists on chain: a mock would credit whoever the app said it credited. Every outcome
 * below is therefore read back from `MembershipManager` and the payment token — never from the
 * screen that just claimed it — and spec 098 FR-017 says so explicitly ("Purchase is a
 * money-costing signature, so the covered flows join the on-chain e2e tier").
 *
 * The invariant every test pins is the one the spec's security review names: on every rail the
 * PAYER and the CREDITED MEMBER are the same address, and it is the acting account. So each
 * test asserts both halves — the tier landed on the acting account, and the price left the
 * acting account — plus the negative: the connected operator's tier and stablecoin balance did
 * not move. There is no rail where the operator's funds buy the acting account's tier.
 *
 * ── THE RAILS, AND WHICH ONES THIS TIER CAN REACH ───────────────────────────────────────
 *   AAP-01  vault, no policy guard  → ONE proposal ([approve, purchase] via MultiSendCallOnly)
 *   AAP-02  vault, spec-049 policy  → TWO proposals at CONSECUTIVE nonces (issue #1368)
 *   AAP-03  recovered legacy account → the spec-088 ceremony's own signer, approve + pay
 *
 * Not reachable here, and deliberately not faked:
 *   · the HARDWARE rail needs a device that can sign and broadcast. The dev-only adapter seam
 *     (`window.__fwHardwareTestAdapter__`) exists to stand in for account DISCOVERY; its
 *     signing entry points reject by design (fast/27-protect-hardware.cy.js), and a fixture
 *     that signed real transactions would be testing the fixture. FR-004 is exercised here
 *     through the legacy account, which takes the identical `acting-signer` branch.
 *   · the PASSKEY-batch rail (FR-006) is personal-only by construction and the passkey tier
 *     runs without a chain.
 *   · the RELAYED rail (FR-007) needs a live relayer; `dev:e2e` sets no VITE_RELAYER_URL, so
 *     `useGaslessWrite` self-submits. AAP-03 therefore exercises the never-stranded fallback
 *     (FR-008) on the acting identity, which is the guaranteed path.
 *
 * Requires `npm run setup:e2e` (which runs `setup:e2e:custody` — a fresh node has no Safe
 * behind the canonical addresses, and the `custodyFixture` task fails loudly if it was skipped).
 *
 * Sub-issue of #1400. Checklist: AAP-01..AAP-03
