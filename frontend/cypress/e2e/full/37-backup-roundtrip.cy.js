/**
 * Encrypted backup and restore, the half that costs gas (spec 032, #1228).
 *
 * The no-chain tier already drives this surface's HONEST-STATE rules — BK-01 (no secret material
 * is ever rendered) and BK-02 (a pointer read that did not settle is never reported as "no
 * backup"). Neither can drive the round trip itself, because recording the pointer is an on-chain
 * transaction the member pays gas for, and admission rule 2 puts that here.
 *
 * What this proves that a mock could not: the pointer the member paid for is ON CHAIN, it names
 * the blob that was actually uploaded, and a device that has been wiped gets its data back by
 * reading that pointer. A dialog saying "backed up" is not evidence of any of it.
 *
 * IPFS is stubbed (`cy.interceptIpfs`), which is the same posture as PRV-04: the stub stores what
 * was uploaded and serves it back, so the encrypt → pin → point → read → fetch → decrypt → apply
 * path runs end to end. Only the storage transport is a double; every assertion below is on chain
 * state or on the member's restored data.
 *
 * Checklist: BKC-01..BKC-02
