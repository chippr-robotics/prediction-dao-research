/**
 * E2E Tests: legacy account recovery — moving the funds (spec 062, Full-tier)
 *
 * NEEDS A CHAIN, and needs one for the right reason: the member signs these transfers with a key
 * they paste in, value leaves an account, and the invariant under test — **one asset failing never
 * aborts the rest** — only exists because real transfers fail one at a time. Against a mock every
 * leg succeeds and the test proves nothing. The import half of the feature (ciphertext at rest, no
 * clear secret anywhere) needs no chain and lives in `fast/28-legacy-recovery.cy.js`.
 *
 * The portfolio the sweep sees is the app's own (`getPortfolioRegistry`): on this chain that is
 * three fungible assets — the wrapped coin, the stablecoin, and the coin itself — both tokens
 * being the local `MockERC20`s the suite already seeds. Nothing here is arranged privately
 * between the test and the chain: the app resolves the addresses through its OWN config, and
 * `before` asserts the chain was seeded with the same ones.
 *
 * The failure in LKR-S2 is a REFUSAL, not a drained balance: `sweepAllAssets` re-reads balances
 * itself, so emptying a token before "Transfer all" just drops it from the run and proves nothing
 * about the assets behind a failure. A token that holds the balance and declines to move it is
 * also the realistic case — a blocklisting stablecoin does exactly that.
 *
 * Every test mints a FRESH legacy EOA. A fixed key would carry balances between runs and make
 * "what moved" a function of how often the suite had been run rather than of the code.
 *
 * Sub-issue of #1228. Flows:
 *   LKR-S1 recovery.sweep-per-asset-outcomes — the whole portfolio moves, ERC-20s then native
 *   LKR-S2 recovery.sweep-per-asset-outcomes — one asset refuses; the others still move
 *   LKR-S3 recovery.import-legacy-key       — storing the key moves nothing on chain
 *
 * Checklist: LKR-S1..LKR-S3
