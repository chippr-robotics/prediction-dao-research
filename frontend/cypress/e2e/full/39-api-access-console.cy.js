/**
 * E2E Tests: the API Access developer console, as a served package (spec 095 / 073, Full-tier)
 *
 * Issue #1285. The console is not host code. It is a spec-073 registry package — third-party-shaped
 * bytes, published to a gateway, committed on chain by `keccak256(manifest.json)`, and executed only
 * after the host re-hashes what it was served. Everything this file asserts about the console is
 * therefore also an assertion about that pipeline: nothing here renders unless the chain and the
 * bytes agree.
 *
 *   API-06  api-access.console  the console is listed, launched and rendered from VERIFIED bytes,
 *                               and the package holds no permission that could sign
 *   API-07  api-access.console  the OpenAPI explorer renders the gateway's own description — and
 *                               renders NO roster when it could not be read
 *   API-08  api-access.console  `/v1/member/me` introspection: the token rides in a header, is
 *                               never persisted, and an unreadable membership stays unreadable
 *   API-09  api-access.console  the try-it panel sends a real GET, and an error is a RESULT
 *   API-10  api-access.console  the key ceremony deep-links to the HOST — a package cannot sign
 *
 * ── WHY THIS NEEDS THE ON-CHAIN TIER ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The no-chain tier stubs the registry read and publishes no package bytes, so `/apps/api-access`
 * there is a refusal, not a console. Reaching the real surface needs a registry that can be written
 * to (submit → approve → `launchable`) and a package staged on a gateway the loader can fetch —
 * which is exactly what `npm run setup:e2e` arranges: `publish:local:miniapps` builds and stages
 * token-mint, clearpath AND api-access through the same `scripts/miniapps/publish.js` pipeline that
 * pins a released package, and `deploy:local:miniapps` puts the registry on the local node.
 *
 * The matrix row `api-access.console` was `partial` for this reason: only the HOST card (the
 * Settings card that mints keys) had coverage, because the console itself could not be launched in
 * the tier its flow was filed under.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS STUBBED, AND WHAT THAT DOES NOT WEAKEN ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * TWO transports, both HTTP, neither of them the trust boundary:
 *
 *  1. THE IPFS GATEWAY. There is no IPFS on this machine, so `cy.intercept` answers the
 *     `/ipfs/<cid>/<path>` fetches the LOADER issues, with the bytes `publish:local:miniapps`
 *     staged. The verification stays entirely real — the loader still takes keccak256 of the
 *     manifest bytes it received and compares it to the hash THE CHAIN holds, then sha256 of the
 *     entry and every declared stylesheet against that authenticated manifest. Stubbing the
 *     transport changes who hands over the bytes, not whether they are allowed to run.
 *
 *  2. THE MEMBER API. The relay-gateway's member API module is not running in this tier (the full
 *     tier's dev server starts a chain, not a gateway), and the console reaches a gateway the
 *     MEMBER types rather than one the build configures — `envPrefix` makes every `import.meta.env`
 *     read `undefined` inside a package, which is why the address is an input and not a constant.
 *     So the console is pointed at `http://localhost:8787` and every response is intercepted. The
 *     bodies are copied from the PRODUCER (`services/relay-gateway/src/memberApi/openapi.js`,
 *     `routes.js#me`, `auth.js`'s three-state membership) rather than invented here: a stub written
 *     to match the test would only prove the spec agrees with itself.
 *
 * What is NOT stubbed: the registry reads, the manifest and file hashing, the host object the
 * package is handed, its store, its toast, and its one navigation into the host.
