/**
 * E2E Tests: Protect — Safe custody and the policy guards (specs 043 / 049 / 068, Full-tier)
 *
 * Custody vaults hold member funds behind a guard that is deliberately NOT upgradeable, so what
 * matters here is what the CHAIN accepted, never what the screen said: every outcome below is read
 * back from the vault itself (owners, threshold, nonce, guard slot, balances).
 *
 * Requires `npm run setup:e2e`, which now runs `setup:e2e:custody` — a fresh node has no Safe
 * behind the canonical addresses the app hard-codes, and no policy guards. The `custodyFixture`
 * task fails loudly rather than mysteriously if that step was skipped.
 *
 * Only CV-01 drives the creation wizard, because only CV-01 is about creating a vault. The rest
 * take an on-chain vault from the fixture and bring it in through the app's own "Load existing"
 * path, so each test spends its assertions on its own flow.
 *
 * CV-02 drives the cycle through a governance change rather than a transfer, because the
 * governance panel is the ONLY propose-from-Protect path by design: there is deliberately no
 * vault-shaped send form, since spending from a vault is a normal transfer made while the vault is
 * your acting account — which is CV-03.
 *
 * Sub-issue of #1228. Flows:
 *   CV-01 custody.create-vault        — create a vault and add its owners
 *   CV-02 custody.propose-and-execute — propose, collect approvals, execute
 *   CV-03 custody.operate-as-vault    — act as the vault, and see which you are
 *   CV-04 custody.policy-v2-adoption  — the vault CONSENTS to the ordered guard, by threshold
 *   CV-05 custody.policy-v2-first-match — the FIRST matching rule decides, and no match denies
 *   CV-06 custody.multi-chain-vault-list — a chain that cannot be read is NAMED, not shown empty
 *   CV-07 custody.policy-v1-enforced   — the spec-049 guard still refuses what breaks its rules
 *
 * Checklist: CV-01..CV-07
