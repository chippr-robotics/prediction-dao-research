/**
 * E2E Tests: bridge and supplied liquidity (spec 067, Full-tier)
 *
 * Issue #1236. Four flows, and every one of them settles its claim from CHAIN STATE rather
 * than from a success message, because the claims are all about who is holding the money:
 *
 *   BL-01  liquidity.supply-uniswap-position   the position NFT is the MEMBER's, not the router's
 *   BL-02  liquidity.pause-stops-new-only      a pause stops new supplies and traps nothing
 *   BL-03  bridge.deposit-member-is-depositor  Across records the MEMBER as depositor
 *   BL-04  bridge.fee-consent-ceiling          the disclosed bps is a ceiling, and 0 shows no line
 *
 * ── WHY THESE ARE ON-CHAIN AND NOT NO-CHAIN ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * "The router never takes custody" is not a rendering fact. A component test can assert what
 * the app INTENDS to send; only a chain can answer who ended up owning the position and whose
 * address Across wrote down. Both are one refactor away from being wrong in a way no unit test
 * would notice — `recipient: address(this)` and `depositor: address(this)` are both perfectly
 * ordinary-looking lines.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE CHAIN IS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The full tier's node boots as chainId 80002 (Amoy-shaped) and `VITE_E2E_AMOY_LOCAL=1` makes
 * the DEV-only seams in config/networks.js + config/contracts.js resolve both routers there.
 * Across and Uniswap are the contracts/mocks stand-ins deployed by
 * `scripts/deploy/deploy-bridge-liquidity.js` — MockAcrossSpokePool records `depositor`
 * verbatim, and MockPositionManager mints to `recipient` and models the member-called exit
 * legs, which is exactly what BL-01/BL-02/BL-03 read back.
