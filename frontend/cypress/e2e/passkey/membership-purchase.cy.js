// =============================================================================
// spec 041 SC-002 / FR-016 — a passkey member BUYS MEMBERSHIP, and the chain says
// who paid for the gas.
//
// ACCOUNT-NATIVE TIER, full stack (chain + EntryPoint v0.6 + alto + the verifying
// paymaster + the relay gateway's /v1/paymaster). Admission rule 2 makes the tier
// mandatory rather than optional: the member signs a batch that moves their USDC,
// so the claim has to be settled against a chain. It also cannot be faked lower
// down — `sponsorPaymasterUrl` resolves at BUILD time (networks.js#passkeyConfig
// from VITE_SPONSOR_PAYMASTER_AMOY), so a build without it never constructs a
// paymaster transport and there is nothing to intercept, and `sendCalls` needs a
// real bundler to turn one WebAuthn ceremony into an executed UserOperation.
//
// ── WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// It replaces `onboarding-journey.cy.js::PK-03`, which was a permanently-skipped
// sketch of "fund → membership → wager" written against three things that do not
// exist (`[data-testid="passkey-account-address"]`, `[data-testid="confirm-passkey"]`
// and a `cy.task('seedUsdc')`). Its reachable halves are already covered —
// first-use activation and a funded passkey account moving real money ride
// `sponsored-userop.cy.js::SU-01` — and the half that was NOT covered is this one:
// driving the multi-step PremiumPurchaseModal from a passkey session, which is the
// only membership rail no other spec exercises (`full/40-acting-account-purchase.cy.js`
// covers the vault and acting-signer rails and says explicitly that the passkey
// batch is out of its reach).
//
// ── THE TWO FACTS, EACH READ FROM THE CHAIN ───────────────────────────────────
// FR-016 is "approve + purchase in ONE ceremony", and spec 050 decides who pays for
// it. So each test pins the same two halves from opposite sides:
//
//   MP-01 sponsored   — the account holds ZERO native token before and after, and the
//                       paymaster's EntryPoint deposit FELL. An ERC-4337 operation is
//                       prefunded by its sender or by a paymaster and by nothing else,
//                       so an op that landed from an account that never held native was
//                       paid for by the pool. The membership itself is `getActiveTier`,
//                       and the price is the USDC delta — never the dialog that just
//                       claimed both.
//   MP-02 refused     — sponsorship is switched off AT THE GATEWAY (SIGUSR2, the real
//                       kill switch), and the purchase still lands, self-funded: native
//                       falls, the pool does not move. That is the never-stranded rule
//                       (spec 050 FR-020) on the membership money path.
//
// ── ON DISCLOSURE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The one cost the confirm UI states is the price: `Confirm Purchase ($X USDC)` and
// the settlement note's "credited to … paid from …". Both tests assert that quoted
// figure against the tier's ON-CHAIN price AND against what actually left the account,
// which is what makes the quote falsifiable. The modal makes no statement about the
// NETWORK fee at all — unlike the transfer surface, which badges "⚡ Gasless · sponsored"
// vs "Network fee applies" (TransferForm.jsx:424-427). That is honest on the sponsored
// path (nothing is charged beyond the price) and under-disclosed on the self-funded
// one; the gap is reported rather than asserted here, because a test that pinned the
// silence would make it permanent.
//
// Sub-issue of #1400 (closes #1407). Checklist: MP-01, MP-02
