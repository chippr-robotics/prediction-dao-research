// =============================================================================
// spec 050 — a passkey member sends money and FairWins pays the gas.
//
// ACCOUNT-NATIVE TIER, full stack (chain + EntryPoint v0.6 + alto + the verifying
// paymaster + the relay gateway's /v1/paymaster). Admission rule 2 makes this
// mandatory rather than optional: the member signs something that costs money,
// so the flow must be proved against a chain.
//
// WHY THIS CANNOT BE FAKED AT A LOWER TIER. `sponsorPaymasterUrl` resolves at
// BUILD time (networks.js#passkeyConfig from VITE_SPONSOR_PAYMASTER_AMOY), so a
// build without it never constructs a paymaster transport and never issues
// POST /v1/paymaster — there is nothing to intercept. `paymaster-disclosure.cy.js`
// covers exactly that build and asserts the honest negative ("Network fee
// applies"); this file is its positive twin and needs the endpoint to exist.
//
// WHAT MAKES THE CLAIM AIRTIGHT. The account is funded with USDC and ZERO native
// token. An ERC-4337 operation must be prefunded by the sender or by a paymaster,
// and nothing else. So an op that lands from an account whose native balance was
// 0 before and 0 after was paid for by the paymaster — the paymaster's EntryPoint
// deposit falling is the same fact read from the other side. No dialog wording is
// load-bearing here; the disclosure assertions are extra, not the proof.
