/**
 * scripts/ops/audit-admin-roles.js — who holds privileged roles, across every chain, right now.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The admin-authority claims in this repo were wrong in both directions for
 * months: `hardhat.config.js` once said the migration was finished (it was not), was corrected to
 * "~260 (contract, role) pairs across eight chains" (overstated by more than two orders of
 * magnitude), and issue #966 planned against that number. Neither figure had been measured. The
 * fix is not a better comment — it is a command anyone can re-run, so the record can be checked
 * instead of believed.
 *
 * READ-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION. `view` calls only, over PUBLIC RPCs. It takes no key, needs no secret
 * profile, and has no code path that sends a transaction — so it is safe to run at any time, by
 * anyone, including while a handoff is half-done. That is the point: an auditor you hesitate to run
 * is an auditor nobody runs.
 *
 * THREE STATES, NEVER TWO. A role read that FAILS is reported `unknown`, never `not held`. This is
 * the estate rule from spec 071 and it matters more here than almost anywhere else: rendering an
 * unreachable chain as "the old Safe holds nothing" would report a completed handoff that never
 * happened. Any chain with an unknown is named, and the totals are labelled partial.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/ops/audit-admin-roles.js                # every chain
 *   node scripts/ops/audit-admin-roles.js --chain 137    # one chain
 *   node scripts/ops/audit-admin-roles.js --json         # machine-readable
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free beyond `ethers`, which the repo already has (spec 097 rule 2: an npm
 * dependency added here re-resolves the root lockfile and drops the platform rolldown binary).
