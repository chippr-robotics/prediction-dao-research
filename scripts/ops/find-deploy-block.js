/**
 * Measure the block a CREATE2-deployed contract was created in, from PUBLIC sources only.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS (spec 104 T-101, issue #1432) ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `deployBlocks.<name>` is the lower bound every log scan in this repo starts from, and every
 * consumer degrades the same way — `record.deployBlocks?.X || 0` — so a MISSING entry does not
 * fail, it starts the scan at block 0 and hangs silently. `CLAUDE.md` already records that exact
 * failure for `safeProposalHub`. The entry therefore has to be recorded, and recorded correctly:
 * a block LATER than the contract's first event quietly misses the oldest members' records, which
 * is worse than the hang because nothing looks wrong.
 *
 * The obvious way to measure it — binary-search `eth_getCode` across history — needs an ARCHIVE
 * node. Measured 2026-09-06 against the endpoints this repo actually ships in
 * `config/networks.js`: only Mordor's public node answers historical `eth_getCode`. Ethereum,
 * Optimism, Base and Arbitrum (publicnode/allnodes) refuse it without a paid token, and Polygon's
 * is pruned. So the archive route cannot be the primary one, and an approach that needs a paid key
 * is an approach nobody runs.
 *
 * This script uses a route that needs no archive node and no API key, and that PROVES its answer
 * rather than estimating it:
 *
 *   1. Read the deployer EOA and the target address out of `deployments/`.
 *   2. Ask a Blockscout instance for the deployer's own transaction list (an EOA's txlist is
 *      indexed even on instances whose INTERNAL-transaction indexing is incomplete — Polygon's is,
 *      which is why `getcontractcreation` and `is_contract` both answer wrongly there for a
 *      CREATE2 contract, and why neither can be used).
 *   3. For each tx sent to the deterministic CREATE2 deployer, recompute
 *      `CREATE2(deployer, salt, keccak(initcode))` from THAT TX'S OWN CALLDATA.
 *   4. The tx whose recomputed address equals the target is the deployment. Its block is the
 *      answer, and the match is arithmetic — not a claim by an indexer we would have to trust.
 *
 * Step 4 is the point: an explorer can be wrong or behind (Polygon's says `is_contract: false`
 * for a contract with 1357 bytes of code), but keccak over the calldata cannot be. The explorer is
 * used only to ENUMERATE candidate transactions; the identification is done here.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/ops/find-deploy-block.js --contract accountFactory
 *   node scripts/ops/find-deploy-block.js --contract accountFactory --chain 137 --write
 *   node scripts/ops/find-deploy-block.js --contract accountFactory --topic0 0x… --verify-before
 *
 * `--write` records `deployBlocks.<contract>` into the matching `deployments/*.json`. It REFUSES
 * to write a block later than the first event when `--topic0` is supplied, because that is the
 * silent-loss case above.
