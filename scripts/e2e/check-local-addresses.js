/**
 * E2E deploy-order gate (issue #1298).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * The frontend does NOT read the local chain's deployed addresses back. It uses the hardcoded
 * block in frontend/src/config/contracts.js that `NETWORK_CONTRACTS` maps the chain id to. So the
 * app is only pointed at the right contracts for as long as those constants happen to equal what
 * the deploys produced — and those addresses move both when a contract changes and when the deploy
 * sequence does.
 *
 * WHICH ADDRESSES MOVE, AND WHY — TWO MECHANISMS, NOT ONE
 * Both are common, they have DIFFERENT remedies, and an earlier draft of this gate named only the
 * first. A report that blames deploy order for an address that moved because a constructor arg
 * changed sends the reader to the wrong file.
 *
 *   1. INIT CODE (CREATE2). Most of scripts/deploy/deploy.js goes through `deployDeterministic` —
 *      CREATE2 via the singleton factory — so the address is keccak over the salt AND THE INIT
 *      CODE. It does not care about the deployer's nonce, but it moves the moment the init code
 *      changes: an edit to the contract's own source or anything it inherits, a compiler/optimizer
 *      settings change, or a different CONSTRUCTOR ARGUMENT. This is the ordinary case — every
 *      contract change moves its address — and the remedy is to re-derive the constants
 *      (`npm run sync:frontend-contracts:local`) and commit them, not to reorder anything.
 *
 *   2. DEPLOYER NONCE (plain CREATE). `upgrades.deployProxy` (scripts/deploy/lib/upgradeable.js)
 *      deploys with plain CREATE, so each proxy's address is a function of the DEPLOYER'S NONCE at
 *      the moment that transaction is sent: `membershipManager`, `wagerRegistry` and `tokenFactory`
 *      in deploy.js, `callsignRegistry` in deploy-callsign-registry.js, plus every `…Impl` behind
 *      them. Any additional deployer transaction inserted BEFORE one of those calls — another
 *      deploy, a role grant, a mock — shifts it by a nonce slot. This is #1289, and the remedy is
 *      to APPEND rather than insert (then re-sync).
 *
 * The two are not independent: a CREATE2 contract whose constructor takes one of those proxies
 * (`membershipVoucher` takes `membershipManager`) has the nonce hazard fed into its init code, so
 * an inserted deploy moves it too. That is why the gate classifies each mismatch by mechanism
 * rather than asserting one cause for all of them.
 *
 * Nothing about the resulting failure names its cause. A read against an address with no code
 * returns empty rather than reverting, so nothing throws and the UI simply never renders. It
 * surfaces 10-15 minutes later as unrelated-looking Cypress timeouts in three different
 * subsystems, on whichever shard happened to pack those specs — which reads like flake and invites
 * a re-run. It is not flake. #1289 burned two full CI cycles on it.
 *
 * The deploy step already carried a comment warning about the ordering. That comment did not
 * prevent the mistake, because a comment is a convention and conventions decay. This is the gate:
 * it runs in seconds immediately after the deploys, compares what the app is hardcoded to use
 * against what was ACTUALLY deployed, and fails naming each key, expected vs actual, and the rule
 * that was broken.
 *
 * WHAT IT COMPARES
 *   what actually deployed  →  deployments/<network>-chain<chainId>-v2.json (written by the deploy)
 *   what the app will use   →  frontend/src/config/contracts.js, the block NETWORK_CONTRACTS maps
 *                              this chain id to (1337 → HARDHAT_CONTRACTS, 80002 → AMOY_CONTRACTS)
 *
 * The target block is read out of `NETWORK_CONTRACTS` rather than from a table kept here, so this
 * gate cannot drift from the map the app itself resolves.
 *
 * FOUR OUTCOMES PER KEY, AND THEY ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE
 *   matched      — hardcoded and deployed agree. The only thing that counts as a pass.
 *   MISMATCH     — the app points somewhere this deploy did not put that contract. FATAL.
 *   UNSET        — the app's constant is empty (its "not deployed on this chain" state) but the
 *                  record shows the contract WAS deployed. The app will behave as though the
 *                  contract does not exist: the surface hides or its calls go nowhere, which is
 *                  the same silent-timeout failure a mismatch causes. FATAL for a deployed
 *                  contract; reported-only for the record's provenance fields (`deployer`,
 *                  `treasury`), which are configuration, not deploys — `treasury` is
 *                  `TREASURY_ADDRESS || deployer`, so a hardcoded constant for it would be a lie
 *                  rather than a fix.
 *   unverifiable — hardcoded, but this record does not carry the key, so nothing is known either
 *                  way. Never a pass, never a failure. The custody contracts (safePolicyGuard,
 *                  safePolicyGuardV2, policyGuardSetup, safeProposalHub) come from
 *                  scripts/deploy/custody/, so a record written by the core deploy alone says
 *                  nothing about them.
 * Addresses the record carries that the app's block has no key for at all are listed too
 * ("unmapped"), because that is how a newly added deploy shows up before anyone wires it in.
 *
 * THE THIRD SOURCE (issue #1298 names three), AND WHAT IS HONESTLY NOT COVERABLE HERE
 * The third source is `frontend/package.json` `dev:e2e`'s VITE_AMOY_UNISWAP_FACTORY / _SWAP_ROUTER
 * / _QUOTER / _POSITION_MANAGER and VITE_AMOY_WMATIC, consumed by the `dex` block in
 * frontend/src/config/networks.js. Those values are the same hazard in a second place, and they
 * are what produced the issue's SW-01 (".trade-summary never found") failure.
 *
 * Two halves, and only one of them can be built at this commit:
 *
 *   what the app will use — covered. `collectSwapValues` reads those names from the environment
 *     AND from `frontend/package.json`'s script strings, so a hardcoded `VITE_AMOY_UNISWAP_QUOTER=0x…`
 *     in a `dev:e2e` script is checked without anyone having to export it first. (An earlier draft
 *     read only `process.env`, which made this whole leg inert in CI, where nothing sets them.)
 *
 *   what actually deployed — NOT coverable here, and not by writing more code in this file. There
 *     is no `deploy:local:swap` in package.json, no swap-mock deploy script under scripts/deploy/,
 *     and no MockUniswapFactory/Quoter/SwapRouter under contracts/mocks/ (only MockUniswapV3Pool).
 *     The mocks the issue measured do not exist in this tree, so there is nothing to record and
 *     nothing to compare against. The issue's ask — "deploy:local:swap should record its addresses
 *     instead of only logging them" — belongs to the commit that reintroduces that deploy; the
 *     record key it must write under is listed in SWAP_ENV_KEYS below so that commit has one place
 *     to look.
 *
 * Until then a swap value that is set but has no counterpart in the record is reported UNRECORDED,
 * naming the missing piece — never passed and never silently skipped. The gate starts enforcing
 * the third source the moment the swap deploy records anything.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/e2e/check-local-addresses.js [--network localhost] [--chainId 1337]
 *                                             [--deployment <path>] [--contractsFile <path>]
 *                                             [--frontendPackage <path>] [--json]
 *
 * Exit code 0 = every hardcoded address the record can speak to matches. 1 = at least one mismatch
 * or a deployed-but-unset contract, or the comparison could not be made at all (missing record,
 * unresolvable block). Reported-only findings never fail the run.
