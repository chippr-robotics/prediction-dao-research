/**
 * E2E matrix tracker-hygiene gate (issue #1400 — "matrix hygiene").
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * `frontend/cypress/coverage/matrix.json` carries an `issue: '#NNNN'` tracker on every `absent` and
 * `partial` row — the promise being "this gap has an open home, go there for the plan to close it".
 * #1400 found that promise was false for most of the matrix: 11 of its 15 absent rows cited issues
 * that were already CLOSED (#1364, #1366, #1370, #1268, #1271). A closed tracker on an open gap is
 * not a paperwork error — it means nobody is notified the gap still exists, and the gate that is
 * supposed to prove coverage progress (`npm run e2e:matrix`) renders a closed issue number next to
 * `absent` and calls that informative. This is also a RECURRING class, not a one-off: #1400 is
 * itself the second time this was found. A comment on a row does not stay true by itself — closing
 * an issue does not walk back to the matrix rows that cited it. Hence a gate, not a note.
 *
 * WHAT IT CHECKS
 * Every `absent`/`partial` flow row's `issue` field must:
 *   1. exist and match `#<number>` (a missing or malformed field is exactly as bad as a bad one —
 *      there is no tracker to check, so there is no plan to close the gap either); and
 *   2. name a GitHub issue that is OPEN in this repository right now.
 *
 * A `covered` or `out-of-scope` row is not checked — those states are not gaps, and forcing an
 * issue reference onto them would just be more paperwork than the reason for this gate justifies.
 *
 * NO-TOKEN BEHAVIOUR IS DELIBERATE
 * Without a token this gate cannot ask GitHub anything, and "could not check" must never render as
 * "passed" — that is the exact failure this gate exists to close (a stale reference sitting there
 * because nothing ever re-verified it). So with no `GITHUB_TOKEN` the gate prints a loud notice and:
 *   - exits 2 (a distinct code from the tracker-found-a-problem case, `1`) unless `--allow-offline`
 *     is passed, in which case it exits 0 so a contributor can run the local suite without a token.
 * CI always carries `GITHUB_TOKEN` and never passes `--allow-offline` — see
 * .github/workflows/e2e-matrix-trackers.yml.
 *
 * An issue that cannot be resolved even WITH a token (a 404, a rate limit, a network error) is
 * likewise never a silent pass — it is reported as its own finding, because a reference nothing can
 * verify is not evidence of an open tracker either.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/e2e/check-absent-trackers.js [--matrix <path>] [--repo <owner/repo>]
 *                                             [--allow-offline] [--json]
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 = every absent/partial row cites a verified-open tracker (or nothing to check, or
 * --allow-offline with no token). 1 = at least one row's tracker is closed, missing, malformed, or
 * unverifiable. 2 = no GITHUB_TOKEN and --allow-offline was not passed.
