/**
 * Grafana alert rules, generated from the catalogue (spec 089, FR-015…FR-018).
 *
 * The estate's existing alerting is entirely about liveness — uptime checks, VM CPU, VM disk. Not
 * one alert is about money. These are.
 *
 * THREE RULES SHAPE EVERY DEFINITION HERE:
 *
 *   1. RUNWAY, NOT BALANCE (FR-015). A balance floor is only correct at the burn rate it was chosen
 *      for; at 10x traffic a "safe" floor is minutes of warning. Alerting on projected runway keeps
 *      the threshold meaningful with nobody editing a number.
 *
 *   2. STALENESS IS ITS OWN ALERT AND NEVER RESOLVES A VALUE ALERT (FR-016). A balance that cannot
 *      be read is not a healthy balance. If a staleness alert could silence a runway alert, the
 *      worst case — we lost sight of the pool AND it is draining — would page nobody.
 *
 *   3. EVERY ALERT NAMES ITS RUNBOOK (FR-018). An alert that says what is wrong but not what to do
 *      gets acknowledged and forgotten.
 */

/**
 * A PLACEHOLDER, resolved by the provisioner against the live stack.
 *
 * It must NOT be `${datasource}`. That is a DASHBOARD template variable: correct on a panel, where
 * the viewer picks a datasource, and meaningless in an alert rule, which has no variable scope. A
 * rule provisioned with it cannot resolve a datasource at all, so its query returns nothing, and
 * `noDataState: Alerting` — which is deliberate and stays — turns that into a firing alert.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-17, 17h after provisioning: ALL 29 rules were firing, every one of them a false
 * alarm, including both runway rules for pools that were perfectly healthy. An alert channel in that
 * state is worse than none, because the real one is now indistinguishable from the noise.
 *
 * It is also not hardcodable: the uid differs per stack (`grafanacloud-prom` here). So the committed
 * JSON carries this sentinel and `provision-grafana.js` substitutes the stack's real Prometheus uid
 * at push time, failing loudly if it cannot find one.
