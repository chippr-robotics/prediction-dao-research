/**
 * C6: an asserted $0 must still describe the tier we actually use.
 *
 * Every other rule in `check:finops` asks whether a source EXISTS. None of them asks whether its
 * declared price is still TRUE, and for most vendors that gap is acceptable — a plan changes when
 * somebody clicks something on a billing page, which is a human event with a human attached to it.
 *
 * The Graph is the exception that made this rule necessary. Its tier is decided by which HOST the
 * app calls: `api.studio.thegraph.com` is the free development tier, `gateway.thegraph.com` is the
 * decentralized network where queries are paid in GRT from a billing balance on Arbitrum One. The
 * entire cost basis therefore flips on a one-line edit to `frontend/src/config/networks.js`, made
 * by somebody thinking about indexing, in a file with no connection to FinOps — and the free
 * allowance does not bill over, it FAILS, so the wrong figure and a member-facing outage arrive
 * together while the dashboard reports everything as free.
 *
 * Driven against a real tree with a real edit, the way the other gate fixtures are: a rule that is
 * only ever exercised on the passing case is a rule nobody has seen work.
