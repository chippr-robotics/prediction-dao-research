/**
 * Bytecode digest snapshot (spec 075, FR-005 / SC-001).
 *
 * Records a sha256 of `bytecode` + `deployedBytecode` for every compiled contract so a build-system
 * change can be PROVEN byte-neutral. Any change to compiler settings, dependency resolution, or the
 * OpenZeppelin version that wins the hoist shows up here as a differing digest.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/codegen/bytecode-digest.js --out <file>          # record
 *   node scripts/codegen/bytecode-digest.js --compare <baseline>  # verify (exit 1 on any diff)
 *
 * --compare trusts artifacts/ ONLY when it is backed by a fresh build marker (issue #1090): a
 * failed or skipped `npm run compile` can leave a stale artifacts/ tree from a PRIOR successful
 * compile in place, and this gate used to hash whatever was there with no way to tell — silently
 * approving a diff it never actually re-compiled. See checkFreshness() below and
 * scripts/codegen/write-build-marker.js (the only thing that writes the marker, as npm's
 * `postcompile` hook — so it never fires on a failed compile).
