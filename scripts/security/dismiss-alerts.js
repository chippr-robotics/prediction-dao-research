/**
 * Dependabot alert dismissals (issue #1520).
 *
 * Twelve of the forty-five open alerts name `@openzeppelin/contracts` and
 * `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable` and describe Solidity this repository never compiles. They
 * cannot be fixed by a bump — `@chainlink/contracts` is exact-pinned under spec 075 because it
 * contributes Solidity source, and `@openzeppelin/*` is held at 5.4.0 deliberately (5.5+ emits
 * `mcopy`, which fails at `evmVersion: paris`). The only correct outcome is a dismissal with the
 * reasoning recorded where the next reader will meet it: on the alert.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT TWELVE CLICKS. Two reasons, and the second is the real one:
 *
 *   1. Twelve hand-typed paragraphs are twelve slightly different paragraphs.
 *   2. A dismissal records a conclusion but not the CRITERIA that reached it. Clicking leaves no
 *      answer to "why those twelve and not a thirteenth". The plan file is that answer, and it is
 *      reviewed in a pull request before it is ever executed.
 *
 * SELECTION IS BY PROOF, NEVER BY ALERT NUMBER. An alert is eligible only when the advisory's
 * vulnerable range EXCLUDES the version this repository actually compiles against. Alert numbers
 * would go stale and would encode nothing; a range test re-derives the argument on every run, so
 * bumping the pin INTO a vulnerable range makes the alerts stop matching instead of being dismissed
 * anyway. An unparseable range counts as INCLUDING the version — not being able to prove code is
 * unreachable is not the same as proving it is (the spec-071 / spec-089 rule: a value exists only
 * when it was read).
 *
 * WHY IT CANNOT RUN IN CI. Dismissing needs write access to Dependabot alerts, and there is no
 * `vulnerability-alerts: write` for `GITHUB_TOKEN` — `dependency-alerts.yml` gets the read half and
 * that is all Actions offers. This runs from an operator's workstation under a token with the
 * `security_events` scope, which is exactly the class of credential spec 097 keeps in Secret
 * Manager rather than a `.env`.
 *
 * DRY RUN IS THE DEFAULT. `--apply` is required to write, and it refuses when the live selection is
 * a different size than the reviewed `expectedCount`: a set that grew is a set nobody looked at.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/security/dismiss-alerts.js              # dry run — print what would be dismissed
 *   node scripts/security/dismiss-alerts.js --apply      # dismiss, needs `security_events`
 *   node scripts/security/dismiss-alerts.js --json
 *   node scripts/security/dismiss-alerts.js --id openzeppelin-nested-unreachable

 * one of which a reviewing agent hit within hours of the plan landing:
 *
 *   1. STALE. #1575 corrected the dismissal comment, but until it merges `staging` still carries
 *      the retracted wording. "Pull staging first, then apply" — the instruction given at the
 *      time — would therefore have stamped the RETRACTED text onto twelve alerts. A
 *      `dismissed_comment` is what the next reader meets, and unlike a file it cannot be fixed by
 *      a later pull request.
 *   2. UNREVIEWED. Nothing stopped someone editing `dismissals.json` locally and applying it. The
 *      review is the only thing standing between a typed paragraph and twelve permanent records.
 *
 * Both are the same bug — executing a plan nobody merged — so both get the same gate: fetch the
 * plan from the review branch and refuse unless it is byte-identical to the one in hand.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO override flag. An override is how this becomes decoration again, and
 * the legitimate path is short: merge the plan, then apply it.
 *
 * An unreadable review branch REFUSES rather than proceeding (the D-05 rule, again): not being
 * able to confirm the plan was reviewed is not the same as it having been.

 * clean selection, and the scope gap does not surface until the write — where the natural reading of

 * That would be a mild annoyance on its own. What makes it worth a gate is the state it can leave

 * unfinished dismissal and editing a reviewed plan. We got away with it because the failing token
