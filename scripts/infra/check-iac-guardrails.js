/**
 * IaC guardrail gate (spec 086, contracts/guardrails.md).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * Generic Terraform linters do not know the three facts that make this estate dangerous:
 *
 *   1. `chippr-bots-site-wp` is SHARED. It hosts a public WordPress VM plus clearpath-*,
 *      fukuii-* and kings-edge-*. `google_project_iam_binding` is one word away from the safe
 *      `google_project_iam_member` and is authoritative for its role PROJECT-WIDE — it silently
 *      strips that role from every other principal. The resulting plan diff looks small and
 *      ordinary, and under automatic apply nobody has to click anything for it to happen.
 *   2. Some resources are UNRECOVERABLE: KMS key versions, secret payloads, and the static IPs
 *      pinned in Cloudflare DNS.
 *   3. One service must stay DECOMMISSIONED. Re-declaring the Cloud Run alto bundler puts two
 *      executors on one EOA — colliding nonces, stuck bundles, both instances reporting healthy,
 *      and no in-band detection.
 *
 * This gate is ONE OF TWO LAYERS. The other is the CI service account not holding the permissions
 * (specs/086-infrastructure-as-code/contracts/ci-identity.md), which is what still holds when this
 * gate is bypassed or wrong. Neither layer is sufficient alone.
 *
 * HCL is scanned textually with brace-aware block extraction rather than a real parser, so the gate
 * runs anywhere Node runs — no Terraform binary, no provider download, no network. That is a
 * deliberate trade: it can be fooled by sufficiently strange formatting, and it is checked in CI
 * alongside `terraform validate`, which catches what a text scan cannot.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/infra/check-iac-guardrails.js [--root <dir>] [--json]
 *
 * Exit code 0 = pass, 1 = at least one violation. Warnings never fail the build on their own.
