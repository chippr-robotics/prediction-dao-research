/**
 * scripts/secrets/check-env-hygiene.js — fail if a managed secret has a value in a local env file,
 * or if an env file contains something that looks like a credential but is not classified.
 * Spec 088. Run in CI as `npm run check:env-hygiene`.
 *
 * This is the gate that makes the migration stick. Moving credentials into Secret Manager once is
 * easy; the failure mode is somebody pasting a key back into `.env` next week to unblock
 * themselves, and nothing noticing. The registry says what is managed; this says the managed things
 * are not also sitting on disk.
 *
 * TWO CHECKS, and the second is the one that catches what the first cannot:
 *
 *   1. NO MANAGED VALUE ON DISK. Any variable named in the registry must be absent or empty in
 *      every scanned env file.
 *   2. NO UNCLASSIFIED CREDENTIAL-SHAPED VALUE. A 64-hex private key, a JWT, or a URL with an
 *      embedded token, under a name the registry has never heard of, is reported. A new credential
 *      arrives under a new name by definition, so a check that only knows current names would never
 *      see the next one.
 *
 * Scans only files git does NOT track (a tracked `.env.example` is meant to hold placeholders), and
 * reports the variable NAME and the reason, never the value.
