/**
 * scripts/secrets/registry.js — the ONE inventory of what this workstation treats as a secret.
 *
 * Spec 088. This file is the answer to "is X a secret, and where does it live?" for every operator
 * tool that runs on a developer or deployment workstation. It is deliberately data, not logic, so a
 * reviewer can audit the whole surface by reading one table.
 *
 * Four invariants, each of which has a corresponding test in `__tests__/registry.test.js`:
 *
 *   1. THE REGISTRY IS AUTHORITATIVE, `.env` IS NOT. `check-env-hygiene.js` reads this table and
 *      fails if a value for any `env` name below is present in a tracked `.env`. Adding a secret to
 *      the repo therefore means adding it here first — there is no path that ships a credential
 *      without it appearing in this list.
 *
 *   2. ONE SECRET MAY FEED SEVERAL VARIABLES, AND THAT IS DECLARED, NOT INFERRED. `POLYGON_RPC_URL`,
 *      `QUICKNODE_POLYGON_RPC_URL` and `ALTO_RPC_URL` were three byte-identical copies of one
 *      QuickNode URL with the token embedded in the path. They are one secret with three `env`
 *      aliases. Three secrets would rotate independently and silently drift — which is exactly how
 *      two of them end up stale and pointing at a revoked token.
 *
 *   3. A PROFILE IS A LEAST-PRIVILEGE BUNDLE. Nothing fetches "all secrets". A tool declares the
 *      profile it needs (`compile` needs none, `verify` needs an explorer key, `deploy` needs a
 *      signing key) and receives exactly that. The profile is also what the Terraform module grants
 *      `secretAccessor` on, so the code and the IAM describe the same thing.
 *
 *   4. CLASSIFICATION DRIVES BEHAVIOUR, NOT DOCUMENTATION. `key` material is refused a `.env`
 *      fallback on a public network no matter what the caller passes (see `fetch.js`), because the
 *      failure mode of getting that wrong is signing a mainnet transaction with a key nobody meant
 *      to use.
 *
 * Secret ids are matched by the spec-087 guardrail G-10 allow-list via `/^fairwins[-_]/`, so every
 * name here must keep the `fairwins-` prefix or `npm run check:iac` will reject the Terraform that
 * declares it.

/**
 * Classification. Determines fallback rules and how loudly a miss fails.
 *
 * - `key`      raw private key material. Never falls back on a public network.
 * - `password` unlocks key material held elsewhere (the floppy keystore).
 * - `token`    a vendor API credential. Losing it degrades a feature, it does not move funds.
 * - `endpoint` a URL with an embedded credential. Secret because of the credential, not the host.
