/**
 * Storage-layout & upgrade-safety gate (spec 025, FR-010/SC-005).
 *
 * Two independent checks per upgradeable contract:
 *
 *   1. UNSAFE PATTERNS in the freshly compiled implementation — constructor state initialisation,
 *      `delegatecall`, `selfdestruct`, missing `_disableInitializers`, and the rest of OpenZeppelin's
 *      implementation validations. Needs nothing but the compiled artifact.
 *
 *   2. APPEND-ONLY COMPATIBILITY against every implementation that is actually LIVE — for every
 *      chain the repo has a deployment record for, not just whichever network hardhat happens to be
 *      pointed at. This is the check that blocks a state-corrupting upgrade before it is applied.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS DOES NOT USE `upgrades.validateUpgrade(deployedAddress, Factory)` ────────────────────
 * It used to, and the result was a gate that reported success without checking anything.
 *
 * That call resolves the deployed layout through the network manifest for the CONNECTED chain, so it
 * only ever works when hardhat is pointed at the chain the implementation lives on. `package.json`
 * defines the script with no `--network` and CI runs it bare, which means it ran against the default
 * hardhat network (chain 1337) — where `deployments/hardhat-chain1337-v2.json` records no
 * implementations at all. Every contract fell through to the "no deployed impl to diff against"
 * branch and printed a ✓. Verified by mutation: inserting a slot above `_apps` in MiniAppRegistry and
 * shrinking its `__gap` — precisely the corruption this gate exists to catch — passed the literal CI
 * command with exit 0, while the same command with `--network polygon` correctly failed.
 *
 * So the comparison is done directly instead. Both sides are available OFFLINE: the compiled layout
 * comes from hardhat's own build info, and each live implementation's layout is already committed to
 * `.openzeppelin/<network>.json`. Nothing here needs an RPC endpoint, a network flag, or a secret,
 * which is the only way a gate like this survives contact with CI.
 *
 * ── UNVERIFIABLE IMPLEMENTATIONS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * An implementation recorded in `deployments/` with no layout in any `.openzeppelin/` manifest cannot
 * be diffed against, and saying nothing about it would be the same lie in a new place. Each one must
 * be declared in `KNOWN_UNVERIFIABLE` with a reason; an undeclared one FAILS. The declared ones are
 * printed on every run so they stay visible rather than becoming permanent silence.
 *
 * Usage: `npm run check:storage-layout` — no network flag needed or used.

/**
 * Live implementations with no committed layout, and why.
 *
 * These are real coverage gaps, not exemptions: an upgrade that corrupts one of these proxies would
 * not be caught here OR at deploy time (`upgrades.upgradeProxy` validates against the same manifest
 * this reads). Listing them makes the gap explicit and, more importantly, makes a NEW one fail —
 * which is the property that stops the set from quietly growing.
 *
 * The Ethereum-mainnet pair share a cause: hardhat cannot deploy contracts on L1 in this repo (the
 * transaction mines but the script dies on an empty `value.to`), so both were deployed with the
 * plain-ethers `scripts/ops/*-direct.js` path, which never goes through hardhat-upgrades and so never
 * records a manifest entry. Fixing that means re-recording the layout, not re-deploying.

 * Ethereum-mainnet `liquidityRouterImpl` is `0x41ba6bca…`, and that SAME address on Arbitrum, Base

 *
 * Two floors rather than one, because they catch different regressions:
 *   · `records`  drops when deployment records go missing or stop being found — the relocation
 *                threat, and the one that leaves proxies silently unchecked.
 *   · `diffed`   drops when verification is weakened without records moving — most realistically by
 *                adding a KNOWN_UNVERIFIABLE entry to silence a failure rather than fix it.
 *
 * They are floors (`>=`), so deploying MORE never fails the gate. Deploying to a brand-new chain is
