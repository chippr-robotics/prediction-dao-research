# Garden of Eden Testnet Seeding Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values

# Seed Player Private Keys (10 accounts for simulating market activity)
# These should be funded accounts on the target network
# 
# ⚠️  CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING ⚠️
# The example keys below (0x...001 through 0x...00a) are WELL-KNOWN TEST KEYS
# and must NEVER be used on real testnets or mainnet. They are only for local
# development. The script will refuse to run with these keys on non-local networks.
# 
# For testnet deployment, generate secure private keys using:
#   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
# 
# WARNING: Never commit real private keys to version control!
