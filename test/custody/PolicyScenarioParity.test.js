/**
 * Spec 068 — the ordered-policy scenarios, driven against the REAL guard.
 *
 * `matchPreview` (frontend/src/lib/custody/policyV2.js) is a client twin of on-chain matching, and
 * the two are meant to move in lockstep. Nothing enforced that: this suite and the Vitest suite
 * each carried their own hand-copied cases, so a divergence would show up as two green suites that
 * disagree about what a vault will actually do.
 *
 * The scenarios now live in ONE file (frontend/src/test/fixtures/policyScenarios.js). This test
 * asserts the CONTRACT obeys them; frontend/src/test/custody/policyV2.test.js asserts the preview
 * agrees with the same table; and the full-tier Cypress spec composes them in the UI. A scenario
 * added in one place is therefore checked in all three, and one that the contract does not honour
 * fails here rather than being quietly re-copied.
 *
 * Deliberately a SEPARATE file from SafePolicyGuardV2.test.js: that suite owns the guard's
 * behaviour in detail (bounds, typed errors, exemptions, approver verification), while this one
 * owns the shared-fixture contract between the three suites.
