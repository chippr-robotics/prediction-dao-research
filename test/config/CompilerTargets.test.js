/**
 * Spec 074, FR-002 / SC-002 — the EVM target must be DECLARED BY THIS REPOSITORY.
 *
 * Before spec 075 only the 0.8.23 compiler entry pinned `evmVersion`. The 0.8.24 entry — 116 of
 * the repo's 120 contracts — and all 38 per-file overrides declared nothing, so their EVM target
 * came from Hardhat's own internal default
 * (config-resolution.js: `compiler.settings?.evmVersion ?? "paris"` for solc >= 0.8.20)
 * while `hardhat` is depended on as a caret range. The EVM target of nearly all deployed bytecode
 * was therefore a property of a floating third-party default rather than of this repo.
 *
 * Why that matters concretely: `shanghai` emits PUSH0 and `cancun` emits MCOPY. Both are
 * undeployable on ETC 61 and Mordor 63 (live networks per CLAUDE.md), and both change deployed
 * bytecode — hence every CREATE2 address — against UUPS proxies at STABLE addresses.
 *
 * READ `hre.userConfig`, NOT `hre.config`.
 * ---------------------------------------
 * This is the whole point of the test and it is easy to get wrong. `hre.config` is the RESOLVED
 * config, into which Hardhat has already substituted its default — so an assertion against it
 * passes whether or not the repo declared anything. Measured at adoption: userConfig reported
 * evmVersion on 0 of 38 overrides while the resolved config reported it on all 38. A test written
 * against `hre.config` is a gate that cannot fail, which is exactly what spec 075 exists to
 * eliminate. `hre.userConfig` is the raw module export and is the only surface that answers
 * "did WE declare this?".
 *
 * Both surfaces are checked below: userConfig for the declaration, hre.config for the effective
 * value that actually reaches solc.
