/**
 * THE catalogue: every FairWins revenue and cost source, declared exactly once (spec 089, FR-001).
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  IF YOU ADD A REVENUE OR COST SOURCE TO THE PLATFORM, ADD IT HERE. `npm run check:finops` fails
 *  until you do, and the failure names this file. That gate is the whole reason this file exists:
 *  "remember to update the dashboard" is a convention, and conventions decay; a red build does not.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Three consumers read this list and must never disagree about it:
 *   services/finops-exporter        emits the metrics
 *   scripts/finops/generate-dashboards.js   builds the panels
 *   scripts/finops/check-finops-coverage.js the gate
 *
 * What does NOT belong here: endpoints, account ids, zone tags, project names, and above all
 * credentials. `credential` names a Secret Manager secret; it never carries one (FR-003). This file
 * is world-readable in the repository.
 *
 * ── `moneyPath`: how the gate SEES an entry in the platform ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * An optional field on any source whose money moves through the relay gateway:
 *
 *   moneyPath: { namespace, payeeEnv?, enableEnv? }
 *
 * `namespace` is the config namespace the coverage gate derives from an env-var prefix
 * (`X402_PAY_TO` => `x402`). `payeeEnv` names the variable that configures the recipient WE control;
 * `enableEnv` names the flag that switches the path on in a deployment.
 *
 * It exists because the original gate discovered new revenue by exactly one route — a FeeRouter
 * `serviceId` — and so was structurally blind to a rail that takes money without registering one.
 * The x402 rail below is exactly that, and it sat uncatalogued with CI green. C2 now also
 * enumerates configured platform payees in the gateway and fails on any namespace no entry claims,
 * and refuses to let a `planned` entry stay `planned` once a committed deployment turns its path on.
