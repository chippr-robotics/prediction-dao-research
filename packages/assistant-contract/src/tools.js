/**
 * The assistant's tool table — ONE definition, three transports (spec 104, research § 8.3).
 *
 * WHO READS THIS
 *   · the relay gateway (FairWins rail) attaches `toolsForMessages(selectTools(...))` to every
 *     upstream Messages request itself — a client never supplies `tools` on that rail;
 *   · the browser loop (both rails) builds the same array and EXECUTES each `tool_use` against the
 *     member API with the session grant, a public gateway route with no credential, or locally;
 *   · the MCP server ships a VENDORED copy (`services/mcp-server/src/toolDefs.snapshot.json`)
 *     because it may take no dependency (spec 095 R4) — `test/mcpToolParity.test.js` fails the
 *     moment the two diverge, in either direction.
 *
 * `exec` IS DATA, NOT A FUNCTION. Each consumer binds it to its own transport:
 *   { kind: 'route',  route: '<contract.js ROUTES id>', query?: [...] }   — a member-API route
 *   { kind: 'public', method: 'GET', path, pathParams?: [...], query?: [...] } — a public gateway read
 *   { kind: 'local' }                                                         — runs in the browser
 * `route` names the id in `services/relay-gateway/src/memberApi/contract.js`, so a tool over a
 * route that does not exist fails `assistantContract.test.js`, never a member.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT (§ 8.4). There is no `build_intent` here: in the browser the member
 * CAN sign, which is exactly why the first in-app tool that returns typed data would be followed by
 * a request for a button that signs it. It stays an MCP-ONLY tool. There is no `navigate`: moving
 * the member's screen from inside a chat turn is an action on the UI they did not take — a link they
 * tap is the honest idiom. And nothing here takes an `account`: a tool that needs a member's
 * authority reads whichever account signed the token, so asking about somebody else is unaskable.
 *
 * THE DESCRIPTIONS ARE LOAD-BEARING. They were written for the MCP server and are the words the
 * model reads before deciding what to claim: each names the honest envelope its result carries
 * (`read` / `not-configured` / `unreadable`) and forbids rendering an unknown as a zero.
 *
 * SORTED BY NAME, ALWAYS. The Messages API renders tools → system → messages and caches by byte
 * prefix, so the tool array must be byte-identical across every request of a conversation
 * (research § 8.6). `TOOL_DEFS` is sorted here and `toolsForMessages` sorts again, so a consumer
 * that filters cannot accidentally reorder.
