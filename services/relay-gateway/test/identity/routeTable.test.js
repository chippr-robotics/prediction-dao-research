/**
 * Protected-route table (spec 105, T007).
 *
 * The important test here is `every mounted route is declared`, and it deliberately enumerates the
 * REAL Express app rather than comparing against a list written by hand. A hand-copied list drifts
 * the moment someone adds a route, and it drifts SILENTLY — the new route simply would not appear
 * in either the list or the table, and a test comparing one to the other would stay green while the
 * route shipped ungated and unmetered. That is exactly how the gateway reached the state this
 * feature repairs, so the guard has to read the source of truth.
 *
 * The reverse direction matters too: a declared route that is not mounted is dead configuration
 * that will read as protection during a review.
