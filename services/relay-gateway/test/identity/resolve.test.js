/**
 * Caller-identity resolution (spec 105, T005).
 *
 * THE LOAD-BEARING TEST OF THE FEATURE is `an acceptance settles it`: a member holding a valid grant
 * must not be downgraded, or handed a 503, because an unrelated challenge service was unreachable.
 * Their credential was checked and it was good; another verifier's outage is not evidence about
 * them. Getting that precedence backwards produces a gateway that refuses paying members whenever a
 * bot-check provider has a bad afternoon, and it would look like a correct fail-closed design while
 * doing it.
 *
 * The second group keeps `rejected` and `unverifiable` apart. They are the two falsy outcomes a
 * boolean would have merged, and merging them is how "our RPC was slow" becomes "your signature is
 * forged" (FR-009).
