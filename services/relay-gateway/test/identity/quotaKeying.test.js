/**
 * Quota keying (spec 105, T028 / SC-004) — the defect at the centre of the feature.
 *
 * Quotas keyed on values taken from the request: an account address out of the path, a collection
 * slug, a search term, and in one case the literal constant `'builder-sign'`. Every one of those is
 * chosen by the caller, so walking any of them minted a fresh bucket per request. Forty requests
 * naming forty addresses cost one unit each, and the ceiling was never approached.
 *
 * It was wrong in the other direction at the same time. A hundred members reading one popular
 * collection shared a single bucket and throttled each other; one script reading a hundred
 * different collections was never limited at all. The keying inverted who it protected.
 *
 * The tests below drive the exact evasion the old code permitted. `test/opensea.test.js` carries
 * the counterpart: an assertion that used to read "a different requested address has its own
 * window" — the bug, encoded as expected behaviour — now inverted.
