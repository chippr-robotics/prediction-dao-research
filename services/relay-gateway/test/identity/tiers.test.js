/**
 * Assurance-tier ladder (spec 105, T002).
 *
 * These are cheap tests over pure functions, and they are here because the ladder is the one thing
 * every other part of the feature compares against. Two properties matter more than the rest:
 *
 *   1. An unknown tier must THROW, not degrade. Returning 0 would silently downgrade a caller to
 *      anonymous; returning -1 would silently satisfy every minimum. Both fail quietly, in opposite
 *      directions, and a route table typo would look like working software either way.
 *
 *   2. `app` must be unreachable from anything a web caller can present (FR-005). A web app cannot
 *      prove its identity to a server, so any code path that concluded otherwise would be claiming
 *      something untrue.
