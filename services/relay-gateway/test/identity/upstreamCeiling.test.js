/**
 * Per-upstream ceilings (spec 105, T030 / FR-013).
 *
 * The requirement says the ceiling is enforced BEFORE the upstream is called, and the whole file
 * turns on proving that literally. **Asserting a 429 would not be enough**: a cap applied after the
 * fetch still lets the request reach the vendor, still gets counted against our key, and on a
 * metered API has already been billed. So the assertions below check that the upstream FUNCTION WAS
 * NOT INVOKED — a receipt versus a budget.
 *
 * The second thing worth pinning is that a cache hit must not spend the ceiling. That is why the
 * check wraps the client and not the route: most requests to these modules are served from cache
 * and never touch the vendor, and a route-level ceiling would exhaust a budget on traffic that
 * spends nothing — refusing callers to protect a credential nobody was using.
