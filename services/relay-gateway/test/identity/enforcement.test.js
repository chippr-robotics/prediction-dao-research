/**
 * Enforcement (spec 105, T025) — the slice that actually refuses.
 *
 * Three properties matter more than the refusal codes themselves, and each is a way this could be
 * shipped wrong while looking correct:
 *
 *   1. READS KEEP SERVING. Enforcement must be invisible on every read surface, including with the
 *      challenge service down. A change that gates reads would look like a working security feature
 *      and read as an outage to every logged-out visitor.
 *
 *   2. UNVERIFIABLE IS 503, NEVER 403. If a dependency was unreachable we do not know whether the
 *      caller qualifies. Answering 403 tells a member their credential is bad because our RPC was
 *      slow — and, being non-retryable, tells their client to stop trying.
 *
 *   3. A BUG IN THIS LAYER MUST NOT OPEN A GATED ROUTE. Signing with the platform's credentials is
 *      exactly what an attacker would want a crash here to unlock. It also must not take the
 *      gateway down, so reads still serve and gated routes answer 503.
