/**
 * Identity wiring, end to end through the real app (spec 105).
 *
 * The unit tests prove each piece behaves. This proves the pieces are actually CONNECTED — that the
 * middleware is mounted where the plan says, that the grant verifier is registered into the live
 * verifier array after the member-API dependencies are built, and that a real signed token
 * therefore moves a real request up the ladder.
 *
 * Worth its own file because the registration is deliberately late: the middleware mounts early
 * (before route dispatch) and the verifier is pushed in later (once the revocation store and
 * membership reader exist). That is correct but easy to break, and if it broke, every unit test
 * here would still pass while the deployed gateway silently resolved every caller anonymous.
