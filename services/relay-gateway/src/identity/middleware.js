/**
 * Caller-identity middleware (spec 105, contracts/gateway-api.md Part 1).
 *
 * TWO SWITCHES, NOT ONE, AND THE SECOND IS THE POINT.
 *
 *   enabled: false            inert. Every caller resolves anonymous; no verifier runs.
 *   enabled, enforce: false   OBSERVE. Identity resolves and is reported; no status code changes.
 *   enabled, enforce: true    refuse a route whose declared minimum is not met.
 *
 * Observe exists so the tier model can be validated against real traffic before anything depends on
 * it. If the model is wrong, the cost is a wrong header rather than refused members — and a safety
 * layer that starts refusing the moment it is deployed fails in the shape "the product is broken",
 * which is the worst way for this particular change to be wrong.
 *
 * ── ORDERING, AND WHY EACH POSITION IS LOAD-BEARING ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   CORS/preflight -> body parse -> ORIGIN LOCK -> [ CALLER IDENTITY ] -> route + quota -> handler
 *
 * AFTER the origin lock. The lock is a cheap string comparison that rejects non-edge traffic;
 * resolution may make a network call. Resolving first would let an off-edge caller cost us an
 * upstream round trip per request — turning an identity layer into an amplifier.
 *
 * BEFORE route dispatch. Identity must resolve for a route that does not exist, or an
 * unauthenticated prober could enumerate the route surface by the difference between "404" and
 * "403", which is a map of exactly which paths are worth attacking.
 *
 * NEVER on a preflight. `OPTIONS` short-circuits at CORS above, because a browser cannot attach
 * credentials to a preflight — it carries none by definition. If resolution ever saw one it would
 * resolve `anonymous` every time and pollute the metering it exists to make honest.
 *
 * ── THE HEADER IS DIAGNOSTIC, NEVER AN INPUT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `X-FairWins-Tier` reports what the gateway concluded. It is never read back, and it deliberately
 * names no application, because the web cannot prove one (FR-005). A caller sending it is ignored.
