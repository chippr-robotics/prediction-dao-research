/**
 * Challenge verifier (spec 105 slice 2, #1444) — proof of HUMAN, and only that.
 *
 * Verifies a Cloudflare Turnstile token against siteverify and answers with the standard verifier
 * contract. What a passing challenge proves is "a real browser on a real device, recently" —
 * nothing about WHICH application sent the request (FR-005), and nothing about who is answerable
 * afterwards. It buys THROUGHPUT (the `human` tier's higher ceilings), never entry: no read
 * route requires it, so everything below shapes rate limits, not access.
 *
 * ── THE FOUR OUTCOMES, AND WHY EACH MAPS WHERE IT DOES ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   no token presented        -> absent        most callers, legitimately
 *   verifier unconfigured     -> absent        an unconfigured bot-check must not deny anyone
 *   vendor says invalid       -> rejected      we asked, the answer was no
 *   vendor unreachable        -> unverifiable  an outage is not evidence about the caller
 *
 * `unverifiable` here never blocks anything on its own: reads sit at the anonymous minimum, so a
 * challenge-service outage costs a caller their tier UPGRADE — a lower rate ceiling — and never
 * access (FR-017). That is the property the whole read-tier design hangs on.
 *
 * ── SINGLE-USE TOKENS, AND THE TRAP THAT FOLLOWS ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A Turnstile token verifies at the vendor ONCE; the second siteverify for the same token answers
 * `timeout-or-duplicate`. Two rules fall out:
 *
 *   CACHE THE VERDICT. A verified token is honoured for `ttlSec` from OUR verification, keyed by
 *   the token's digest, so one challenge serves a visitor's whole session (SC-003) instead of one
 *   request. Without the cache, the SECOND request carrying a perfectly good token would be
 *   REJECTED by the duplicate rule — the widget would have to re-run per request.
 *
 *   SINGLE-FLIGHT CONCURRENT VERIFIES. A page firing several requests at once presents the same
 *   fresh token in parallel. Verified independently, exactly one wins and the rest are branded
 *   duplicates — a racy 50/50 rejection of honest traffic. Concurrent verifies of one digest
 *   share one in-flight result instead.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS REMEMBERED, AND WHAT NEVER IS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The cache holds SHA-256 digests and expiry times — never a raw token. The digest doubles as the
 * metering subject for the `human` tier (data-model §2): stable for the token's lifetime, useless
 * to replay, and safe in a quota key. Raw tokens and the shared secret never reach a log, an
 * error, or a cache key (FR-037).
