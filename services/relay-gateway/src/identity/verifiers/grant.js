/**
 * Grant verifier (spec 105, FR-003) — proof of control, and separately proof of membership.
 *
 * Wraps the EXTRACTED credential core from `memberApi/auth.js` rather than reimplementing it. A
 * second signature path would be exactly the drift this repo's type-parity gates exist to prevent,
 * and the three-verdict rule is too easy to get subtly wrong twice.
 *
 * ── THE ONE SUBTLETY THAT MATTERS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * An unreadable membership does NOT make this verifier unverifiable.
 *
 * By the time membership is read, the signature has already been checked and passed. We KNOW who is
 * calling — that fact is established and does not become uncertain because a second, independent
 * read timed out. So the verifier accepts at `address` and simply does not offer the `member`
 * upgrade. Reporting `unverifiable` instead would hand a 503 to a caller whose credential we
 * successfully verified, on a route that only ever needed proof of control — turning an unrelated
 * RPC hiccup into a refusal for the routes this feature exists to protect.
 *
 * This is the same principle as the resolver's precedence rule, one level down: evidence that was
 * obtained stays obtained.
 *
 * ── MAPPING ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   no Authorization header            -> absent        (not a rejection; most callers have none)
 *   signature verified                 -> accepted @ address
 *     ...and membership active         -> accepted @ member
 *     ...and membership unreadable     -> accepted @ address   (see above)
 *   signature invalid / expired / revoked -> rejected
 *   reference chain unreachable        -> unverifiable  (401 would say "forged" and be wrong)
 *
 * A contract account (a passkey member) has no public key, so ECDSA recovery does not produce their
 * address and the ERC-1271 leg is a network read. If that read cannot be made the answer is
 * UNKNOWN — never "invalid".
