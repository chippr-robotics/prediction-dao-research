/**
 * Protected-route declarations (spec 105, data-model §4) — THE ONE TABLE.
 *
 * The middleware, the operator disclosure, the metering attribution and the least-privilege tests
 * all read this file. Two rules govern it, and both are the point rather than decoration.
 *
 * ── SILENCE IS NOT PERMISSION ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A route absent from this table is a CONFIGURATION ERROR, not an implicitly public route. That is
 * the deny-by-default posture the platform already applies to vault policy, and it is what stops a
 * new credential-spending route from shipping unlisted and unmetered — which is precisely how the
 * gateway arrived at the state this feature repairs. `routeTableTest` asserts the mounted set and
 * the declared set are the same, in both directions: a declared route that is not mounted is dead
 * configuration, and a mounted route that is not declared is a hole.
 *
 * ── A CHALLENGE IS A METERING UPGRADE, NEVER AN ACCESS GATE ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every READ sits at `anonymous`. Tier does not decide WHETHER a read is served — it decides HOW
 * MUCH (the per-tier ceilings in the quota layer). This is FR-006 and FR-017 together, and the
 * first draft of the data model got it wrong: putting a `human` minimum on reads turns an
 * unreachable challenge service into a non-retryable 403 on exactly the surfaces that must keep
 * working. A logged-out visitor also then needs a challenge ceremony during boot, before the first
 * market fetch, which is a worse product for no security gain. Reads never refuse for want of a
 * tier; they slow down.
 *
 * ── WHY WRITES ASK FOR `address` AND NOT `member` ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * These routes are irreversible (a broadcast), or they spend the platform's commercial standing (an
 * order signed with our builder credentials). What they need is an ANSWERABLE PARTY — someone
 * stable, revocable and attributable. They do not need a customer. The spec-095 verifier refuses
 * without an active PAID membership, so demanding `member` here would stop an unpaid member from
 * trading at all: a severe regression, and one this table would have introduced silently.
 *
 * ── WHY SOME ROUTES SIT AT `anonymous` DESPITE MOVING VALUE ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `/v1/intents` and `/v1/paymaster` are SELF-AUTHENTICATING: the member's own signature is inside
 * the payload and is verified by the route, and both already enforce spend caps and per-account
 * quotas. Adding a tier minimum in front of them would not make them safer — it would break the
 * never-stranded rule by requiring a second credential to submit an intent the member already
 * signed. `/v1/member/*` likewise runs its own verifier and answers its own errors; this layer
 * observes it and does not second-guess it.
