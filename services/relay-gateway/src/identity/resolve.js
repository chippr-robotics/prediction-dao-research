/**
 * Caller-identity resolution (spec 105, data-model §2/§3).
 *
 * Runs every registered verifier over one request and folds their verdicts into a single
 * `CallerIdentity`. This is where the feature's two most load-bearing rules live.
 *
 * ── RULE 1: `verificationState` IS NOT A BOOLEAN ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A credential can fail in two categorically different ways:
 *
 *   rejected      the credential was examined and is not valid
 *   unverifiable  a dependency could not be reached, so nothing is known
 *
 * A boolean has ONE falsy value and would force those to share it. That collapse is exactly the bug
 * FR-009 exists to prevent: `rejected` is a denial, `unverifiable` is a retryable 503, and telling a
 * member their own signature is forged because an RPC was slow is the specific failure the spec-084
 * message-signing rules already forbid elsewhere. A contract account (a passkey member) has no
 * public key, so "we could not check" is what a perfectly legitimate signature looks like from
 * outside. The type is what keeps them apart.
 *
 * ── RULE 2: AN ACCEPTANCE SETTLES IT, EVEN IF ANOTHER VERIFIER TIMED OUT ──────────────────────
 *
 * Precedence, in order:
 *
 *   1. any verifier ACCEPTED   -> verified, at the highest accepted tier
 *   2. else any UNVERIFIABLE   -> unverifiable, at anonymous
 *   3. otherwise               -> verified, at anonymous
 *
 * Rule 1 before rule 2 is deliberate and is the single easiest thing to get wrong here. A member
 * holding a valid grant must NOT be downgraded, or handed a 503, because an unrelated challenge
 * service was unreachable. Their credential was checked and it was good; another verifier's outage
 * is not evidence about them.
 *
 * Note what rule 3 does NOT do: it does not treat "nobody presented anything" as an error. An
 * anonymous caller is a first-class, expected outcome — read routes sit at the anonymous minimum
 * precisely so they never refuse for want of a tier (FR-006).
 *
 * ── VERIFIER CONTRACT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   verify(req) -> { kind, outcome, tierIfAccepted, subject?, detail? }
 *   outcome     : 'accepted' | 'rejected' | 'unverifiable' | 'absent'
 *
 * Verifiers are independent and ORDER-FREE — none may depend on another having run — and none may
 * throw to deny. A thrown error is indistinguishable from a bug, so one is caught here and recorded
 * as `unverifiable`, never as `rejected`: a crashing verifier must not silently start denying real
 * callers.
