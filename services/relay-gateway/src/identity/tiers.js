/**
 * Assurance tiers (spec 105, data-model §1) — what was actually PROVEN about a caller.
 *
 * The central idea of the feature, and the reason it exists: the gateway holds every third-party
 * credential the platform owns and, before this, authenticated no caller at all. The origin lock
 * proves a request transited Cloudflare — a header the edge injects zone-wide, for an attacker's
 * request exactly as for ours — and CORS is a browser-only control that a script or a server
 * ignores. Neither says who is calling.
 *
 * FIVE RUNGS, AND THE TOP ONE IS UNREACHABLE ON THE WEB:
 *
 *   anonymous  nothing; the request arrived
 *   human      a real browser on a real device, recently          (a verified challenge)
 *   address    control of a specific account                      (a verified grant signature)
 *   member     that, PLUS an active paid membership               (the grant + a tier read)
 *   app        this exact signed application binary               (device attestation — NOT BUILT)
 *
 * WHY `address` AND `member` ARE SEPARATE. The spec-095 verifier answers 403 `membership_required`
 * unless the account holds a live paid tier. So "member-verified" already means "has paid", not
 * "proved control of this address" — and gating trading, broadcast or listing on it would stop any
 * member without a paid tier from trading at all. Proof of CONTROL is what those routes actually
 * need: a signer is stable, revocable, attributable and rate-limitable, which is everything
 * metering and accountability require. Whether they also bought a membership is a product question
 * this layer must not answer by accident.
 *
 * WHY `address` OUTRANKS `human`. It is strictly more accountable. A challenge token proves a
 * browser existed for a moment; an account proves who is answerable afterwards.
 *
 * WHY `app` EXISTS BUT IS NEVER REACHED. A web application CANNOT cryptographically prove its
 * identity to a server — anything the app can send, a member can read out of the shipped bundle and
 * replay. Real proof-of-app exists only on the native shells (hardware-rooted attestation), which is
 * a separate, deferred piece of work. The rung is declared so the ladder does not have to be
 * reshaped later, and `verifiers/attestation.js` is a registration seam that always abstains. FR-005
 * forbids any surface claiming this tier was reached on the web, and `isProofOfApp` below is how
 * calling code asks that question without re-deriving the answer.
