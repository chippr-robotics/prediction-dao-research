/**
 * Per-upstream spend ceilings (spec 105, FR-013).
 *
 * ── A CAP CHECKED AFTER THE CALL BOUNDS NOTHING ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The requirement says "enforced BEFORE the upstream is called", and the word is doing real work.
 * A limit applied to the response is a receipt, not a budget: by then the request has been made,
 * the vendor has counted it, and — for a metered API — we have already been billed for it. The
 * only cap that bounds anything runs before the fetch.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS WRAPS THE CLIENT AND NOT THE ROUTE ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The obvious place is the route's `guard()`, alongside the per-caller quota. That would be wrong,
 * because most requests to these modules are served from cache and NEVER TOUCH THE UPSTREAM. A
 * route-level ceiling would count cache hits against the vendor's budget, so a well-cached endpoint
 * under heavy read load would exhaust a ceiling it was not spending — refusing callers to protect a
 * credential nobody was using.
 *
 * Wrapping the client puts the check exactly where the money is: one tick per real outbound call.
 *
 * ── THIS IS NOT THE PER-CALLER QUOTA, AND THEY ANSWER DIFFERENT QUESTIONS ────────────────────
 *
 *   per-caller quota  "is THIS caller taking more than their share?"   -> fair use
 *   upstream ceiling  "are we about to overspend THIS credential?"     -> blast radius
 *
 * A single abusive caller is caught by the first. A leaked credential, a broken client looping, or
 * simply more legitimate traffic than the vendor plan allows is caught only by the second. Both are
 * needed, and neither substitutes for the other.
 *
 * ── HONEST FAILURE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Hitting the ceiling is a 429 with `upstream_ceiling_reached` — a distinct code from the
 * per-caller `quota_exceeded`, because a caller who has taken nothing must not be told they have
 * taken too much. The reason says the platform is at its limit for this data source, which is the
 * truth and is actionable by an operator rather than confusing to a member.
