/**
 * Perps read proxy routes — /v1/perps/* (spec 082).
 *
 * Contract: specs/082-perps-trade-view/contracts/gateway-perps-api.md.
 * Pipeline per request: killswitch -> enabled check -> param validation -> quota -> per-venue
 * cached fetch. READ-ONLY by design: there is no write route in this module (FR-018 — no in-app
 * execution this release), so a total outage leaves every value path intact (FR-016).
 *
 * The core rule is PER-VENUE ISOLATION (FR-004): each venue resolves independently to
 * read|degraded via its own cache key; a degraded venue contributes no rows and is reported in
 * `sources` — it never blanks the others and never renders as zeros. Serve-stale is bounded:
 * the TTL cache marks stale values, and anything older than STALE_FACTOR x TTL degrades instead.

 * Hyperliquid perp dexes (HIP-3) — the fan-out, and the budget that shapes it
 *
 * Hyperliquid hosts validator-operated perp dexes beside its own book, and every `/info` read
 * defaults to the FIRST one. Reading only that one is how spec 082 reported "no open perp
 * positions" to a member holding 35 of them (hyperliquid-decision.md §5.2). So both reads fan out
 * across the discovered dex list.
 *
 * THE BINDING CONSTRAINT IS THE VENUE'S PER-IP RATE LIMIT, and the gateway is ONE IP for every
 * member (§2.5): 1200 request-weight per minute. The published weights make the arithmetic:
 *
 *   - `clearinghouseState` weighs 2. A 10-dex position fan-out is 20 weight per refresh, and the
 *     15s cache bounds one member to 4 refreshes/min => ~80 weight/min per actively-viewing
 *     member. That is the cost of telling the truth about a member's own positions and it is paid.
 *   - `metaAndAssetCtxs` weighs 20. A 10-dex PAIRS fan-out is 200 weight per refresh, which at the
 *     15s cache would be 800/min — two thirds of the entire budget for a market table nobody is
 *     necessarily looking at. The pairs feed is GLOBAL and single-flight cached, so its cost is
 *     fixed rather than per-member, and it is the one read that can honestly be slowed down: the
 *     non-default dexes get their own longer floor below (~40 weight/min at 10 dexes).
 *
 * Neither knob may ever silence a dex: a dex that was not read is NAMED in `sources.hyperliquid`,
 * because an unqualified absence is precisely the defect being fixed.
