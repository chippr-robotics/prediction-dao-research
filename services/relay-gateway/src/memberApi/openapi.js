/**
 * The OpenAPI 3.1 document for the member API (spec 095).
 *
 * THIS IS THE SPECIFICATION, and it is code rather than a checked-in YAML file for one reason:
 * a hand-maintained document drifts from the server, and the moment it does it is worse than
 * nothing — an agent generated from a stale spec fails at a member's request instead of at review.
 * Here the paths come from `contract.js`'s `ROUTES` (the same array `routes.js` mounts), the scopes
 * and error codes come from the same constants the handlers enforce, and the buildable-action enum
 * comes from `@fairwins/intent-types` itself. `test/memberApi.test.js` asserts the documented set
 * and the mounted set are equal, so the drift is a test failure rather than a support ticket.
 *
 * Interpolating config also lets the document describe THIS gateway: which chains it serves, which
 * of them have a wager indexer, which chain membership is read on, and whether the assistant is
 * configured. A generic document would force every client to discover those by trial.
