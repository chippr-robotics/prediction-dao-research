/**
 * Member API routes — /v1/member/* (spec 095).
 *
 * Contract: specs/095-member-api-agentic-access/contracts/member-api.md, and the OpenAPI document
 * this module itself serves at /v1/member/openapi.json.
 *
 * Structured exactly like src/perps/routes.js: module killswitch -> global killswitch -> enabled
 * check -> per-route auth -> handler, with the gateway-wide nested `{ error: { code, reason } }`
 * body. Paths come from `contract.js`'s ROUTES, which `openapi.js` also reads, so the served
 * specification and the mounted server cannot drift.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE CAN AND CANNOT DO. Every route here is a READ, a QUOTE, or the registration of a
 * member-signed revocation. There is no route that moves value and no credential in the process
 * that could: a capability token authorises the gateway to ANSWER QUESTIONS about a member, never
 * to act as one. Relaying a signed intent stays where it already was — the public `POST /v1/intents`
 * — because that pipeline recovers the signer itself, and duplicating it here would mean two places
 * deciding what a signature authorises.
 *
 * OPTIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE. Off unless MEMBER_API_ENABLED=true, and off means 503
 * `member_api_unconfigured` on every route including the OpenAPI document, so a client can tell
 * "the operator turned it off" from "this gateway is too old to have it". The router is mounted
 * unconditionally for exactly that reason.
