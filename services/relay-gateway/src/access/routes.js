/**
 * Keyed RPC access issuance (spec 106) — `POST /v1/access/rpc`.
 *
 * Hands a client a short-lived, read-only credential for a dedicated provider endpoint, so keyed
 * read capacity never has to be compiled into a build. The client then reads DIRECTLY from the
 * provider: this route issues, it never carries traffic (FR-030) — the gateway must not become an
 * RPC passthrough, which is the surface spec 105 exists to prevent.
 *
 * ── TIER SHAPES WHAT IS ISSUED, NEVER WHETHER (FR-022) ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Issuance is open to the ANONYMOUS tier. Keyed reads are not a member benefit — a design that
 * leaves logged-out visitors on throttled public capacity has not solved the problem keyed
 * capacity was bought for. What tier buys is lifetime: a proven caller holds a credential longer
 * and re-mints less often. Metering keys on the resolved caller subject, which the caller cannot
 * choose.
 *
 * ── EVERY REFUSAL HERE MEANS "FALL BACK TO PUBLIC CAPACITY" ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Including the enforcement refusals. The member-facing outcome of ANY answer other than 200 is a
 * degraded read over public endpoints, disclosed as degraded — never an error surface (FR-028).
 * The distinct codes exist for the operator and the client's fallback logic, not for a member to
 * read.
 *
 * ── DORMANT BY DEFAULT, HONESTLY (FR-015 discipline) ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The module mounts unconditionally and answers 503 `access_unconfigured` until an endpoint, a
 * signing key and the admin credential are all configured — the platform's standard
 * optional-module pattern, so the answer is always honest and turning it on is config, not a
 * deploy.
