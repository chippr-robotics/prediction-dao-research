 *      roll-up happens only where a rate is available and is labelled as converted (FR-013).
 *   2. `revenue_accrued` IS NOT REVENUE RECEIVED and is excluded from the revenue total. Adding them
 *      double-counts every fee that has since been withdrawn.
 *   3. `revenue_waived` IS NOT REVENUE. It is revenue we did not earn.
 *   4. A TOTAL MISSING A SOURCE IS PARTIAL and names what it is missing. Never silently understated.
