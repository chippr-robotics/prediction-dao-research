/**
 * Per-source collection scheduling with failure isolation (spec 089, FR-007, FR-009).
 *
 * Two properties, both of which are the point:
 *
 *   1. INTERVALS ARE PER SOURCE. An on-chain balance changes every block; the BigQuery billing
 *      export lags hours and is billable to query. One global interval would either make the runway
 *      alerts useless or make the exporter a cost center of its own (FR-029 would then be measuring
 *      the wrong thing about us).
 *
 *   2. ONE FAILING SOURCE FAILS ALONE. A collector that throws, hangs, or returns nonsense yields
 *      `unreadable` for its own source and touches nothing else. A scrape NEVER fails because a
 *      vendor is down — a 500 on /metrics would blank every panel including the ones that are fine.
 *
 * The scheduler holds the last Reading per source and serves it to the scrape. Scrapes are therefore
 * cheap and constant-time, and a slow vendor cannot stall Prometheus.
