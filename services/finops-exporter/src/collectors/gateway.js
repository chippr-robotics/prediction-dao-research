/**
 * Gateway usage collector (spec 105/#1447) — WHO is spending the platform-held credentials.
 *
 * Scrapes the relay-gateway's counters endpoint (an UNPUBLISHED compose-network port — reachable
 * from this exporter, invisible from outside the VM) and emits per-tier and per-upstream request
 * counts as `vendor_usage` series. This is the series that says where the QuickNode account's
 * 50 req/s went, and which assurance tier the collectible/prediction-market keys are being spent
 * for.
 *
 * ── WHY IN-PROCESS COUNTERS ARE ADMISSIBLE HERE, WHEN THE CATALOGUE REJECTS THEM FOR REVENUE ─
 *
 * `sources.js` refuses gateway counters as a REVENUE source, and its reasoning stands: a counter
 * that resets on restart yields an UNDERCOUNT that still looks like a number, and a revenue level
 * is a level. These are COUNTERS consumed as rates: cumulative-since-boot, scraped into the
 * metrics pipeline (whose WAL is the persistence), and `rate()` treats a reset exactly the way it
 * treats every process restart in every Prometheus deployment — a moment of zero slope, never a
 * negative, never a phantom level. The failure mode the catalogue rule exists for cannot occur in
 * this shape, which is why the FR-033 amendment says the collector persists what it scrapes
 * rather than pretending the gateway can.
 *
 * ── HONESTY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Unreachable is `unreadable`, never zero — a gateway that cannot be scraped is not a gateway
 * serving no traffic. Unset URL is `not-configured`. An unrecognised response shape is an ERROR:
 * a zero parsed out of the wrong shape would report "no consumption" for a gateway that is
 * definitely consuming.
