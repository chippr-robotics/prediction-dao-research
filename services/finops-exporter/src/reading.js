/**
 * A Reading is the ONLY thing a collector may return (spec 089, FR-006).
 *
 * The three states are constructed by three functions, and only one of them accepts a value. That is
 * the enforcement: there is no code path that produces "zero because the read failed", because the
 * constructor for a failed read takes no number. A `?? 0` has nowhere to live.
 *
 * This matters more here than anywhere else in the codebase. On a cost dashboard, a source that
 * failed to load and a source that cost nothing are the difference between "we are fine" and "we are
 * bleeding and blind", and they render identically the moment a zero is allowed to stand in for an
 * absence.
