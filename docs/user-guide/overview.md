# User Experience Overview: Navigating Prediction DAO

This documentation suite guides you through the complete user experience of Prediction DAO's two platforms: ClearPath for institutional governance and FairWins for open prediction markets. Rather than treating these as separate technical manuals, we've written them as interconnected narratives that show how real people accomplish their goals using these systems.

## How This Documentation Works

Traditional software documentation often presents features as lists with step-by-step instructions. While such approaches prove useful for reference, they can make it difficult to understand how features connect or how the system supports larger goals. We've taken a different approach.

These guides walk you through experiences as they unfold. You'll follow users through their journeys, see how they make decisions, understand what information they consider at different points, and observe how various features come together to support specific outcomes. This narrative style aims to build intuition about the system's logic rather than just catalog its capabilities.

You don't need to read everything sequentially. Each document stands independently while connecting to the broader picture. Start wherever your interests or needs lead you, and follow references to related topics when you want deeper understanding.

## The Documentation Structure

### User Journeys

The User Journeys document explores typical paths through both platforms from a user's perspective. It shows how someone new to the system discovers it, chooses between ClearPath and FairWins, learns the core mechanics, and develops sophistication over time.

You'll see how a DAO member participates in governance through ClearPath, expressing beliefs through prediction markets rather than simple votes. You'll experience how a trader evaluates proposals, makes position decisions, and manages risk across multiple markets. You'll understand how someone creates their first prediction market in FairWins, thinking through resolution criteria and attracting participants.

This document emphasizes the flow of experience rather than isolated actions. Each section builds on previous understanding, showing how users develop mental models of how futarchy works and how prediction markets aggregate information.

### Practical Scenarios

While User Journeys describes general patterns, Practical Scenarios digs into specific situations with named characters facing concrete challenges. These stories illustrate how different features work together to solve real problems.

Sarah submits her first proposal, learning about bonds, welfare metrics, and community engagement. Marcus develops a trading strategy based on identifying market inefficiencies, showing how privacy protection enables his approach. Elena creates a prediction market with careful attention to resolution criteria. David provides oracle reporting services, demonstrating how data verification works. Lisa challenges an incorrect oracle report, exercising the accountability mechanisms.

Each scenario reveals different aspects of the system through someone using it for a particular purpose. You might recognize yourself in one of these stories or find inspiration for approaches you haven't considered.

### Understanding the Interface

The Interface Guide explores what you see when you use the platform and what those interface elements mean. Rather than clicking through screenshots with numbered annotations, this document walks through the interface as you experience it.

You'll understand what the dashboard shows and how to read it for different purposes. You'll see how proposal and market detail pages organize information to support your evaluation process. You'll learn what happens when you initiate a trade, what the system does with your transaction, and how zero-knowledge proofs protect your privacy without requiring you to understand cryptography.

This document emphasizes that the interface enables your decisions without prescribing them. It provides information, shows consequences of options, and streamlines execution while respecting that you make the substantive judgments about what to do.

### Using the System

The Using the System document provides more structured guidance about specific interactions. If the other documents tell stories, this one offers clearer instructions while maintaining readability.

You'll find guidance about connecting wallets, navigating different interface sections, understanding market phases and proposal lifecycles, managing your portfolio, and interpreting various system states. The document includes visual diagrams showing flows and relationships between components.

While more instructional than the narrative documents, this guide still focuses on your perspective and goals rather than just describing technical operations. It helps you understand not just how to do things but why you might want to do them and what happens as a result.

### Submitting Proposals and Trading on Markets

These two documents go deeper into specific activities many users will want to undertake. They combine narrative elements with practical guidance and examples.

The Submitting Proposals guide walks through everything involved in creating a proposal for ClearPath. You'll understand what makes proposals successful, how to choose appropriate welfare metrics, how to write compelling descriptions, how to structure milestones, and what happens through each phase of the proposal lifecycle.

The Trading on Markets guide explains prediction market mechanics in accessible terms. You'll learn about conditional tokens, how LMSR pricing works (without needing to understand the mathematics), what different trading strategies exist, how to manage positions, and how to interpret market signals. The privacy protection features and their implications for trading strategy receive detailed attention.

Both documents recognize that proposal submission and trading involve judgment calls unique to your situation. They provide frameworks for thinking about these decisions without prescribing specific choices.

### FAQ

The FAQ answers common questions users actually ask. Rather than anticipating every possible question, it focuses on the ones that come up repeatedly in practice.

You'll find answers about basic concepts (what is futarchy, how do prediction markets work), participation requirements (what you need to get started, how much it costs), technical details (how privacy protection works, what key changes do), and procedural questions (how long processes take, what happens if things go wrong).

The FAQ format provides quick access to specific information when you need it. Cross-references connect questions to more detailed documentation in other guides.

## Reading Paths: Finding What You Need

Different readers approach documentation with different goals. Here are suggested paths based on what brings you here.

### If You're New to Prediction DAO

Start with the Getting Started guide to understand prerequisites and basic setup. Then read User Journeys to see how the system works from a user's perspective. This combination provides foundation without overwhelming you with details.

After understanding the basics, explore the Interface Guide to learn what you'll see when you use the platform. Then dive into either Submitting Proposals or Trading on Markets depending on what you want to do first.

The FAQ becomes valuable as specific questions arise during your exploration. Return to it when you encounter terms or processes you don't fully understand.

### If You Want to Submit a Proposal

Begin with the Submitting Proposals guide for detailed guidance about the process. Read Sarah's story in Practical Scenarios to see a complete proposal journey from idea to execution.

Review the User Journeys section about proposal submission to understand how it fits into the broader governance context. Check the Interface Guide sections about proposal creation and monitoring to see what the actual interface looks like.

Consult the FAQ for specific questions about bonds, timing, welfare metrics, or other procedural details.

### If You Want to Trade on Markets

Start with Trading on Markets to understand prediction market mechanics and trading strategies. Read Marcus's story in Practical Scenarios to see how an experienced trader approaches the markets.

The User Journeys section about becoming a trader shows the learning progression from first trade to portfolio management. The Interface Guide sections about market interfaces and portfolio management explain what you'll see and interact with.

The FAQ answers specific questions about pricing, risk, redemption, and technical issues you might encounter.

### If You Want to Create Prediction Markets

Focus on the FairWins sections of User Journeys and read Elena's story in Practical Scenarios. These show the market creation process and the creator's responsibilities.

The Interface Guide describes the market creation interface and what decisions you'll need to make. The Trading on Markets guide helps you understand the trader's perspective, which informs how you should design your market for participant success.

Check the FAQ for questions about resolution, disputes, and creator responsibilities.

### If You're Evaluating the System

Read the Introduction sections of User Journeys and Understanding the Interface to grasp the overall approach. Skim Practical Scenarios to see diverse use cases in action.

The system overview documentation (linked from these guides) provides technical architecture and design rationale. The security documentation explains privacy mechanisms, anti-collusion features, and safeguards.

The FAQ's general questions section addresses fundamental questions about futarchy, governance approaches, and why the system works the way it does.

## The Documentation Philosophy

These guides share several principles that shape how they present information.

### Narrative Over Lists

We prefer paragraphs that flow naturally over bulleted lists that feel like AI-generated summaries. When you encounter a list in these documents, it's because that structure genuinely serves the content better, not because we defaulted to listing as an easy format.

Features and concepts appear embedded in stories and explanations rather than catalogued independently. This approach takes more words but builds better understanding of how pieces fit together.

### User Perspective Over System Perspective

The documentation frames everything from your viewpoint as someone using the system. We ask "what do you see and why might you care" rather than "what does the system do."

This user focus means technical details appear when relevant to your understanding rather than for completeness. If you need comprehensive technical specifications, the developer documentation and reference materials provide that. These user guides prioritize helping you accomplish goals.

### Context Over Instructions

Rather than "click this button, enter this value, click that button," the guides explain what you're trying to accomplish, what information you need to make good decisions, and what happens as a result of your actions.

The interface changes over time, but the concepts and decision processes remain stable. By emphasizing context and reasoning over specific button locations, the documentation stays relevant even as interface details evolve.

### Respect for Judgment

The guides never tell you whether to trade PASS or FAIL, whether to submit a particular proposal, or whether a market price is correct. These require judgment calls based on information and analysis only you can provide.

The documentation helps you understand what factors matter for these decisions, how to evaluate relevant information, and what consequences different choices entail. It enables your judgment rather than substituting its own.

### Honesty About Complexity

Prediction markets and futarchy involve genuine complexity. The documentation doesn't pretend this away or oversimplify to the point of inaccuracy.

Instead, it manages complexity through progressive disclosure. Basic concepts appear in straightforward language. Deeper details emerge when you need them for advanced usage. Technical mechanisms receive explanation when relevant to your decision-making without overwhelming you with implementation details you don't need.

When something is actually complex (like understanding why markets aggregate information effectively), the guide acknowledges this and provides the explanation or reasoning you need rather than reducing it to superficial soundbites.

## Connecting User Experience to System Purpose

These guides ultimately serve a purpose beyond helping you navigate interfaces. They aim to help you understand why the system works the way it does and how your participation contributes to larger goals.

### Futarchy as Governance

ClearPath implements futarchy: the idea that communities should vote on values and bet on beliefs. The user experience supports this by making welfare metric governance accessible while enabling prediction markets to evaluate proposals efficiently.

When you trade on proposals, you're not just speculating for potential profit. You're contributing to collective intelligence that helps the DAO make better decisions. Your research and analysis become part of the price signal that determines whether proposals execute.

The privacy protection, anti-collusion features, and accountability mechanisms all serve to make this collective intelligence genuine rather than compromised by manipulation or coercion.

### Open Prediction Markets

FairWins enables anyone to create markets on any question. This openness serves the broader goal of making prediction markets accessible beyond formal governance contexts.

When you create a market with clear resolution criteria and resolve it fairly, you expand the ecosystem of questions people can express beliefs about. When you trade on markets bringing relevant knowledge, you help prices reflect reality accurately.

The user experience emphasizes flexibility and accessibility while maintaining the standards (like challenge mechanisms and evidence requirements) that make prediction markets trustworthy.

### Privacy Preserving Infrastructure

Both platforms share privacy-preserving infrastructure because the user experience depends on it. If traders could see each other's positions, front-running, vote buying, and social pressure would compromise the information aggregation process.

The zero-knowledge proofs, encrypted positions, and key-change capabilities all protect your ability to participate honestly. The documentation explains these features in terms of what they enable for you rather than how they work technically.

## Beyond This Documentation

These user guides form one part of broader documentation that includes developer guides, system architecture explanations, security analysis, and reference materials.

The developer documentation helps people build on or contribute to the platforms. It covers smart contract architecture, frontend development, testing practices, and deployment procedures.

The system overview documentation explains the technical design decisions, privacy mechanisms, security model, and governance structures that underpin user-facing features.

The security documentation details the testing, auditing, and verification processes that protect users and ensure system integrity.

All these documentation streams connect through consistent principles about clarity, honesty, and respect for readers. Whether you're using the platform, building on it, or evaluating it, the documentation aims to provide the understanding you need.

## Living Documentation

This documentation evolves as the platform develops and as user needs become clearer. The narrative approach requires more maintenance than simple feature lists, but produces better understanding.

If you encounter sections that confuse rather than clarify, if you have questions the documentation doesn't address, or if your experience differs from what the guides describe, that feedback helps improve future versions.

The documentation succeeds when it helps you accomplish your goals with confidence. Whether you're participating in DAO governance through ClearPath, creating or trading on prediction markets in FairWins, or exploring these systems to understand futarchy and prediction markets generally, these guides aim to support your journey from first encounter through to sophisticated engagement.
