# Understanding the Interface

This guide explains what you see when using the platform and what interface elements mean from a user's perspective.

## Landing and Dashboard

The landing page presents ClearPath (DAO governance with futarchy) and FairWins (open prediction markets). After connecting your wallet and choosing a platform, the dashboard becomes your home base.

The central area shows active proposals or markets with titles, current prices, time remaining, and volume indicators. Sort by criteria relevant to your purpose: time remaining, trading volume, or position size. Your positions section displays token types, entry/current prices, and unrealized profit/loss. Settled positions show final outcomes with "Redeem" buttons for winners.

ClearPath displays welfare metrics (treasury value, network activity, security, developer momentum) with current values and trends. FairWins shows market categories, trending topics, and approaching resolutions.

## Proposals and Markets

Clicking a proposal or market reveals details supporting evaluation. The description explains objectives, budget, timeline, and team. Welfare metric justification (ClearPath) or resolution criteria (FairWins) help you assess success likelihood. Budget breakdowns show fund allocation. Milestones define deliverables with completion criteria.

The market interface shows PASS/FAIL (or YES/NO) prices with evolution charts. A 0.72 price suggests 72% collective belief in success. Price charts reveal how consensus developed. Volume indicates participation depth.

## Trading

When trading, select your token and amount. The interface shows price impact (LMSR means larger trades push prices further) and estimated gas costs with speed options. After confirmation, zero-knowledge proofs generate in your browser (takes a few seconds). The transaction goes to blockchain, and your position appears in your portfolio once confirmed.

## Creation Interfaces

### ClearPath Proposals

The submission flow requests title, description (markdown editor with preview), funding amount, recipient address (with verification warnings), welfare metric selection (dropdown with context), and milestones (flexible card-based builder). A review screen lets you check everything before posting the 50 ETC bond.

### FairWins Markets

Market creation emphasizes precise question framing and resolution criteria. Define your question, elaborate on edge cases and evidence sources, choose resolution date, stake initial liquidity (minimum 100 USDC), post creator bond, and preview how your market appears to traders.

## Portfolio Management

The portfolio view aggregates all positions. Summary metrics show total value, unrealized P/L, and capital deployed. Positions group as active, pending resolution, or settled. Sort by P/L, time remaining, or size.

Individual position details show entry history, current state, and action options: increase position, decrease, or exit completely (for active positions). Pending resolution shows oracle status and challenge period timing. Settled positions display redemption rates and payout amounts.

## Interface Philosophy

The interface provides information, shows consequences, and streamlines execution without prescribing decisions. Market prices appear neutrally. Actions remain accessible without pressure. Complexity reveals progressively: basics immediately, advanced features when relevant, technical details when needed.

Privacy encrypts positions automatically. Key-change is available when needed. The interface succeeds when it fades into transparent infrastructure, letting you focus on substantive questions rather than navigation mechanics.
