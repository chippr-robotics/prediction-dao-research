# Practical Scenarios: How Users Navigate Real Situations

This guide explores concrete scenarios that users encounter, showing how the system responds to real needs and how different features come together to support specific goals.

## Sarah's First Proposal: From Idea to Execution

Sarah noticed her DAO needed better documentation. After months of participating in governance discussions, she recognized that new members struggled to understand the system, and proposals often required extensive explanation in community channels. She believed comprehensive documentation would increase participation and reduce confusion.

She started by gathering evidence. She reviewed recent proposals that faced unnecessary questions, surveyed new members about their challenges, and sketched an outline of documentation structure. This preparation would strengthen her proposal before submitting.

Opening the ClearPath proposal submission interface, she considered which welfare metric made sense for evaluation. Documentation primarily helps with network activity by reducing barriers to participation, so she selected that metric. She could justify this choice by explaining how better documentation should translate to more active users and higher transaction volumes.

Writing the proposal description, Sarah focused on clarity. She explained the current problem with specific examples, described the documentation she would create, outlined a realistic timeline with milestones, and detailed her qualifications based on past technical writing experience. She included a budget breakdown showing costs for her time, technical illustrations, and user testing feedback sessions.

The 50 ETC bond requirement gave her pause, but she felt confident enough in her proposal's merits to proceed. She reviewed everything twice, checked the recipient address three times, and submitted the transaction. The confirmation showed her proposal entering the review period.

Over the next week, community members asked questions. Why this budget amount? How would she measure documentation quality? Would the content be maintained after creation? Sarah answered each thoughtfully, refining her thinking through these exchanges. Some feedback led her to wish she could adjust the proposal, but she understood that immutability prevented last-minute gaming.

When trading began, she watched prices with nervous interest. Initial trading pushed PASS tokens to 0.52, a marginal positive signal. Over the following days, prices drifted up to 0.61 as more people considered her proposal. She didn't trade on her own proposal, preferring to let others evaluate it independently.

Near the end of the trading period, a respected community member wrote a detailed analysis supporting the documentation initiative. PASS prices jumped to 0.73 within hours. Sarah felt grateful for this endorsement while recognizing that the market had spoken: the community believed her proposal would improve network activity metrics.

After trading closed, an oracle reporter submitted values showing baseline network activity at 8,750 (the current index level) and projected activity at 9,100 if documentation improved as predicted. The two-day challenge period passed without disputes. Resolution confirmed PASS tokens won, and Sarah's proposal would execute after the timelock.

During the timelock, Sarah prepared to start work. No one ragequit, suggesting broad support. When execution completed, funds transferred to her address, and she began creating documentation. She understood that oracle reporting in three months would measure whether network activity actually increased, creating accountability for her commitments.

## Marcus's Trading Strategy: Finding Market Inefficiencies

Marcus approached prediction markets systematically. He didn't claim special insights into most proposals, but he excelled at identifying market inefficiencies where prices didn't reflect available information.

One morning he noticed a proposal requesting funds for a security audit. The proposal seemed solid: experienced auditor, reasonable budget, clear scope. But PASS tokens traded at only 0.38, suggesting the market believed the audit unlikely to improve treasury value metrics (the selected welfare metric for this proposal).

Marcus dug deeper. The proposal description explained how security audits increase treasury value by preventing exploits that could drain funds and by increasing confidence that attracts more participants and capital. He checked recent security news and found several high-profile DAO exploits that cost millions. The risk reduction seemed genuinely valuable.

He reviewed the auditor's track record, finding consistently good work with multiple successful engagements. The budget appeared fair compared to market rates. So why did the market price this at only 38% likelihood of success?

Reading community discussions, Marcus found the answer. Many traders misunderstood the welfare metric connection. They thought about security audits as defensive spending that doesn't directly generate returns, missing the insurance value and confidence effects. The market inefficiency stemmed from incomplete analysis rather than hidden information he lacked.

Marcus bought PASS tokens at 0.39, accumulating a substantial position over several transactions. His zero-knowledge proofs encrypted these purchases, preventing others from simply copying his moves. As he traded, prices gradually increased to 0.41 from his own buy pressure, but remained well below what he considered fair value.

Over the next week, others apparently reached similar conclusions. Either through independent analysis or noticing the security audit's quality, more traders bought PASS tokens. Prices climbed to 0.54, then 0.62, eventually settling around 0.69.

Marcus monitored his unrealized gains. He'd bought at an average price of 0.40 and current prices around 0.68 meant significant paper profits. He considered taking profits by selling some tokens, but decided to hold through resolution. His conviction in the analysis remained strong, and early exit would forfeit the conditional token payout mechanism.

When resolution occurred, the oracle reported treasury values with and without the security audit's confidence effects. The careful analysis showed measurable improvement, and PASS tokens won. Marcus redeemed his position for a 73% return on his initial capital, validating his efficiency-seeking approach.

He didn't view this as exploiting others' mistakes. The market mechanism requires informed traders to correct mispricing, and his research added valuable information to collective pricing. His profits represented payment for that research work and risk-taking.

## Elena's Market Creation: Building Community Around Predictions

Elena followed an emerging blockchain project with significant developer activity. She thought their upcoming mainnet launch would influence the broader ecosystem, but no existing prediction market addressed this question. FairWins provided the tools she needed to create one.

She thought carefully about framing the question. Too vague and disputes would arise; too narrow and few people would care. She settled on: "Will Project X's mainnet launch occur by December 31st with at least 1,000 active validators as reported by their official network statistics dashboard?"

This phrasing defined success precisely. The date boundary was clear. The validator threshold set a meaningful bar beyond just launching. The evidence source (official dashboard) would be accessible to everyone. She anticipated potential disputes about edge cases, so she added clarification: "Launch means the network is live and accepting user transactions. A testnet phase that extends past December 31st does not count. The validator count must hit 1,000 within the first 48 hours of mainnet operation."

For the resolution evidence source, she planned to use the project's public API documentation page showing real-time validator counts, archived via Internet Archive for verification. She'd also reference official announcements from the project team's verified social media accounts.

Elena staked her creator bond and provided initial liquidity: 100 USDC to seed the LMSR market maker. She set the trading period for 90 days, giving enough time for information to emerge about the project's readiness without extending so long that interest would wane.

After creating the market, she shared it in relevant communities. She joined discussions about Project X, not to promote her market directly but to participate authentically in conversations where people already discussed launch timing. When appropriate, she mentioned the prediction market as a way to express beliefs about the timeline.

Trading started slowly. Early participants took small positions, with YES tokens around 0.50 (neutral pricing). As the project shared development updates, trading increased. Good news pushed YES tokens up; delays or concerns brought them down. Elena watched these price movements as a signal about community consensus regarding launch readiness.

She didn't trade on her own market. As creator, her responsibility was fair resolution, not profit-seeking. If she bought YES tokens and then controlled resolution, others might suspect bias. Better to remain neutral and let the market function independently.

Two weeks before the deadline, the project announced they'd delay mainnet launch by a month. YES token prices crashed to 0.18 as traders updated their beliefs. Elena's market would resolve NO, but this was exactly the information revelation purpose she'd hoped for. The market successfully aggregated knowledge about launch timing.

When December 31st passed without mainnet launch, Elena submitted resolution evidence: screenshots from the official dashboard showing testnet status, archived links to project announcements about the delay, and confirmation the validator threshold wasn't met. The challenge period passed without disputes.

She'd created a market that functioned as intended, provided value to participants who used it to track launch progress or hedge against delays, and resolved fairly according to predefined criteria. Her reputation as a market creator grew, making future markets she created more likely to attract participants who trusted her commitment to fair dealing.

## David's Oracle Reporting: Providing Data Verification

David specialized in data verification. He understood welfare metrics thoroughly and had systems for collecting the historical data needed to report oracle values accurately. When proposals entered resolution phase, he often served as oracle reporter.

A proposal for a developer grant program just finished trading. The welfare metric being evaluated was developer activity, measured through GitHub statistics: commit counts, pull request activity, active contributor numbers, and repository growth. David needed to calculate the baseline value and the projected value if the grant program succeeded as planned.

He queried the GitHub API for the relevant metrics over the past quarter. His scripts pulled data for commit counts (1,247), pull requests merged (342), active contributors (67), and watching repositories (2,890). Using the weighting formula from the welfare metric definition, he calculated a composite score: 8,234.

The projected value required more judgment. If the grant program succeeded in attracting developers as proposed, how much would these metrics improve? He reviewed the proposal's specific commitments: funding for 5 new full-time developers over 6 months, hackathon sponsorship expected to engage 20+ occasional contributors, and documentation improvements that might increase repository follows.

Based on similar programs in other ecosystems and conservative estimates, David projected the metrics might reach: commits (1,550), pull requests (425), active contributors (82), watching repositories (3,200). This yielded a composite score of 9,105, representing 10.6% growth.

He documented his methodology thoroughly. The IPFS hash he'd submit would point to a detailed report showing all raw data, calculation steps, and reasoning about projections. Anyone challenging his report would need to identify specific errors in data or logic.

David posted his 100 ETC oracle bond and submitted his report through the interface. The system accepted it, initiating the two-day challenge period. He monitored community channels for reactions, prepared to defend his methodology if questions arose.

One community member asked about the projection methodology, noting that 10.6% growth seemed conservative. David explained his reasoning: developer hiring often takes longer than expected, hackathon participants sometimes don't convert to regular contributors, and he preferred underestimating to avoid inflating expectations. The questioner seemed satisfied with this explanation.

No formal challenges materialized. When the challenge period ended, David's values were accepted as final. PASS tokens won (the grant program was expected to improve developer activity), and David's oracle bond returned plus a small reporting fee. His reputation for careful, conservative reporting grew stronger.

He viewed oracle reporting as essential infrastructure. Markets only function when resolution happens fairly and accurately. By doing this work competently, he enabled the futarchy system to operate as intended. The bonds at risk ensured reporters took the responsibility seriously, while the reporting fees compensated for the time and systems needed to produce quality data.

## Lisa's Challenge: Disputing Incorrect Data

Lisa noticed something wrong. An oracle reporter had just submitted values for a proposal evaluated against treasury value metrics. The reporter claimed the baseline treasury value (measured through time-weighted average price of holdings) was 42.3 million ETC, but Lisa's own tracking showed it should be around 38.7 million.

She investigated carefully before considering a challenge. Her 150 ETC challenge bond would be forfeit if she was wrong, creating strong incentive for accuracy. She reviewed the treasury composition: various token holdings, liquidity positions, and staked assets. She recalculated the TWAP calculations using multiple data sources.

The discrepancy appeared to stem from how the oracle reporter valued one major holding. The reporter used a 30-day TWAP that included a brief price spike later identified as a wash trading attempt. Lisa's analysis used a cleaned dataset that filtered out those suspicious transactions, resulting in a lower valuation.

She felt confident the challenge had merit. The welfare metric definition specified using "clean market data free from manipulation attempts," and the wash trading incident had been discussed extensively in governance forums. The oracle reporter should have applied the same filtering.

Lisa submitted her challenge through the interface, posting the 150 ETC bond. She provided detailed evidence: her own TWAP calculations with methodology, transaction data highlighting the wash trading, previous governance discussions about filtering such data, and comparison showing how the different approaches yielded different valuations.

The challenge initiated formal review. UMA token holders would arbitrate the dispute, examining both the original oracle report and Lisa's counter-evidence. This escalation mechanism provided final resolution when reporters and challengers disagreed.

Lisa monitored the UMA review process. Multiple UMA voters examined the evidence over several days. Discussion forums showed they took the question seriously, debating the proper interpretation of "clean market data" and whether the specific transactions qualified as manipulation attempts.

The UMA vote concluded in Lisa's favor. The oracle reporter's values were rejected, the reporter's 100 ETC bond was slashed, and Lisa received a portion of that bond plus her own bond back as a reward for catching the error. More importantly, corrected treasury values were used for proposal resolution, ensuring the decision reflected accurate data.

She felt good about the outcome beyond the financial reward. The challenge mechanism worked as intended, providing accountability for oracle reporting and correction mechanisms when errors occurred. The system's resilience to gaming or mistakes depended on community members like her willing to invest time verifying data and challenging issues when found.

## Robert's Ragequit: Exercising Minority Protection

Robert strongly opposed a proposal that had just passed. The proposal would allocate significant treasury funds to a project he believed fundamentally misaligned with the DAO's values. Market prices indicated majority support with PASS tokens winning 0.68 to 0.32, but Robert's analysis suggested the market had overlooked crucial considerations.

He'd traded FAIL tokens during the trading period, believing the proposal would harm rather than help the selected welfare metric. When resolution confirmed PASS tokens won and the proposal would execute, he faced a decision: stay in the DAO and accept the outcome, or use the ragequit mechanism to exit.

Ragequit allowed him to withdraw his proportional treasury share during the two-day timelock period before execution. If he held 2.3% of governance tokens, he could claim 2.3% of treasury assets. This Moloch DAO inspired feature protected minority rights, ensuring governance couldn't force participation in decisions members found unacceptable.

Robert calculated his potential exit. His governance token holdings represented about 1.8% of the total supply. The treasury held various assets totaling approximately 18 million ETC equivalent value. His proportional share would be around 324,000 ETC worth of mixed assets.

The decision wasn't purely financial. Exiting meant leaving a community he'd participated in for over a year. He'd lose influence over future decisions and miss any benefits if this proposal somehow succeeded despite his concerns. But staying meant tacitly accepting a direction he believed fundamentally wrong.

He talked with other community members who shared his concerns. Several felt similarly conflicted. They discussed coordinating their ragequit decisions to send a stronger signal, but ultimately each had to make their own choice.

Robert decided to ragequit. He initiated the process through the interface, which calculated his exact proportional share and prepared asset transfers. His governance tokens would be burned, and he'd receive his proportional treasury allocation in return.

The transaction processed smoothly. He received a mix of assets matching the treasury composition: primarily ETC but also some other tokens and liquidity positions. He'd need to manage these assets independently now, but he felt better having extracted himself from a decision he opposed.

The DAO governance discussions noted the ragequit activity. Several members, including proposal supporters, acknowledged it as healthy system function rather than hostile action. The minority protection mechanism let Robert exit gracefully while letting the majority proceed with their chosen direction. Neither side could claim the other behaved unreasonably.

## Maya's Portfolio Management: Balancing Multiple Positions

Maya maintained active positions across seven different proposals simultaneously. Each represented a distinct bet on proposal quality and welfare metric impacts. Managing this portfolio required systematic approach and continuous monitoring.

Her portfolio view showed each position with current market values and unrealized profit/loss figures. Three positions showed gains as markets moved in her predicted directions. Two showed modest losses where her analysis apparently missed something. Two remained near entry prices as markets stayed uncertain.

She used the portfolio analytics to understand her overall risk exposure. Too much concentration in proposals evaluated against the same welfare metric would create correlation risk. If treasury value metrics generally underperformed, all those positions might suffer together. She wanted diversification across different metric types and proposal categories.

One proposal concerned her. She'd bought PASS tokens expecting the proposal to succeed, but negative information had emerged during the trading period. The proposal team missed a milestone, and community sentiment turned skeptical. PASS prices declined from her 0.58 entry to 0.43 current price.

Maya faced a decision: cut losses by selling now, or hold hoping for recovery. She reviewed the new information carefully. The missed milestone was concerning but not fatal. The team provided an explanation and revised timeline that seemed reasonable. Market overreaction might have pushed prices too low.

She decided to hold, reasoning that the selling pressure reflected panic more than fundamental analysis. This decision involved risk, but her portfolio approach meant no single position could devastate her overall capital. She'd sized each position appropriately for her risk tolerance.

Another position offered profit-taking opportunities. She'd bought FAIL tokens at 0.37, and mounting evidence suggested the proposal would indeed fail to improve its target metric. FAIL prices had risen to 0.59. She could exit now, locking in 59% returns, or wait for resolution hoping for even better results.

She chose to take profits. While the conditional token payout at resolution might exceed current market prices, she'd already identified a new opportunity where her capital could potentially generate similar returns. Efficient capital deployment meant rotating out of winners approaching resolution into newer opportunities with more uncertain pricing.

Her trading pattern involved continuous rebalancing. As some positions matured toward resolution, she exited partially to redeploy capital. As new proposals entered trading phases, she researched them and took initial positions. The portfolio maintained roughly constant exposure while individual holdings cycled through the system.

This active management approach required time and attention. Maya checked markets daily, read proposal updates, monitored welfare metrics, and adjusted positions based on new information. She'd developed this skill over months of participation, learning to balance research depth with portfolio breadth.

The privacy protection helped her portfolio strategy. If others could see her positions, they might front-run her trades or infer her information sources. Encrypted positions let her trade on her analysis without immediately revealing her strategy to the market.

## Tom's Key Change: Protecting Against Coercion

Tom received a troubling message. Someone offered to pay him if he'd vote particular ways on upcoming proposals. The message explained he could prove his positions by sharing his encryption keys, allowing verification of how he traded.

This vote-buying attempt wouldn't work if Tom used the key-change feature. The MACI-inspired mechanism let him change his encryption key, invalidating any previous commitments. If he shared keys with the would-be vote buyer, he could then change them, making the old keys useless for verifying his actual positions.

Tom reported the attempt in community channels and initiated a key change. The interface generated a new encryption key pair, updated his account, and invalidated his previous keys. Any positions he'd encrypted with old keys remained his, but he couldn't use the old keys to prove what those positions were.

This created a credible commitment not to sell votes. Even if he wanted to (which he didn't), he couldn't prove his voting positions in a way the buyer could verify before paying. The key-change capability broke the verification mechanism that vote buying required.

The broader community appreciated the key-change feature because it prevented an entire class of attacks. Without it, wealthy actors could buy outcomes by paying many traders to vote particular ways. With it, traders could always defect after accepting payment, making vote buying unreliable and therefore uncommon.

Tom continued participating normally after his key change. His positions remained intact, market function continued without disruption, and he'd successfully defended against the coercion attempt. The system's anti-collusion properties protected both individual autonomy and collective decision quality.

## The Common Thread: System Support for User Goals

These scenarios demonstrate how the platform supports different user goals through consistent mechanisms. Whether submitting proposals, trading for profit, creating markets, verifying data, exercising minority rights, managing portfolios, or protecting against coercion, users find the system adapts to their needs.

The privacy protection appears in every scenario, enabling honest participation without fear of front-running or social pressure. The market mechanisms provide liquidity and price discovery across all contexts. The governance structures ensure fairness through bonds, challenges, and accountability mechanisms. The conditional token framework makes everything work technically while the welfare metrics provide objective evaluation standards.

Users don't need to understand every technical detail to navigate successfully. Sarah submitted a proposal by focusing on clear description and appropriate metric selection. Marcus traded by identifying mispricing and doing research. Elena created markets by defining questions precisely and committing to fair resolution. Each found success by understanding the parts relevant to their goals while the system handled the complexity.

This documentation aimed to show the platform through user experiences rather than feature lists. Your own journey will create new scenarios these examples didn't cover, but the underlying patterns remain consistent: the system provides tools, users apply them toward their goals, and the collective intelligence emerges from these individual actions adding up to something larger than any single participant could achieve alone.
