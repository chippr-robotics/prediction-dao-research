# User Journeys Through Prediction DAO

This guide walks you through the complete experience of using ClearPath and FairWins, showing how different participants interact with the platform from their first visit through to achieving their goals.

## Understanding Your Entry Point

When you first arrive at the platform, you encounter a fundamental choice that shapes your entire experience. The landing page presents two distinct pathways, each designed for different purposes but built on the same secure foundation.

ClearPath serves organizations that need formal governance structures. If you represent a DAO managing a treasury, coordinate protocol decisions, or need transparent evaluation of proposals with built-in minority protections, this path offers the institutional framework you need. The system integrates futarchy principles where the community democratically establishes what success means, then lets prediction markets aggregate knowledge about which proposals will achieve those goals.

FairWins opens prediction markets to anyone with a question worth answering. Whether you want to forecast event outcomes, create custom markets on topics that interest you, or participate in open trading without governance overhead, this path provides the flexibility and accessibility you seek. You control the resolution criteria, set your own parameters, and engage with a community of traders who bring diverse perspectives.

Both platforms share the same privacy-preserving infrastructure, protecting your positions through zero-knowledge proofs while maintaining market transparency. The choice between them reflects your needs rather than technical differences.

## The ClearPath Experience: Participating in DAO Governance

### Joining as a New Member

Your journey with ClearPath begins when you connect your wallet. The dashboard welcomes you with a view of active proposals, each representing a decision the DAO faces. Unlike traditional voting where you simply approve or reject ideas, ClearPath invites you to express your beliefs through markets that aggregate knowledge.

The welfare metrics displayed near the top show what the DAO values. These measures of success were established through democratic voting, defining treasury value, network activity, security posture, and development momentum as the standards against which all proposals are evaluated. Understanding these metrics helps you interpret what each proposal aims to achieve.

As you browse active proposals, you see markets in various states. Some just entered their trading period, offering early opportunities before widespread information spreads. Others approach resolution, their prices reflecting accumulated knowledge from weeks of trading. Each market presents PASS and FAIL tokens, conditional instruments that pay based on whether the proposal succeeds in improving the relevant welfare metric.

### Becoming a Trader

Your first trade might feel complex, but the interface guides you through the process naturally. You select a proposal that interests you, perhaps one requesting funding for a marketing campaign evaluated against network activity metrics. The proposal details explain the objectives, budget, timeline, and team credentials.

The market shows current prices: PASS tokens trading at 0.65 ETC, FAIL tokens at 0.35 ETC. These prices suggest the market believes the campaign has about 65% probability of increasing network activity. You review the proposal more carefully, considering whether this price accurately reflects reality.

As you prepare to trade, the system generates a zero-knowledge proof that encrypts your position. This happens seamlessly in your browser, protecting your privacy while allowing the market to function. You don't need to understand the cryptographic details; you simply confirm your trade, and the system handles the complexity.

Your position now exists privately. Other participants see aggregate market prices adjust, but cannot identify your specific holdings. This privacy proves crucial as it prevents vote buying, front-running, and the social pressure that might compromise your independent judgment.

### Monitoring Your Positions

Days pass as the trading period continues. You check your portfolio occasionally, seeing how market prices evolve as new information emerges and other traders adjust their positions. The unrealized profit and loss figures help you understand your position's current value, though you cannot yet redeem anything.

The proposal moves through its lifecycle: trading ends, an oracle reporter submits welfare metric values, a challenge period opens where anyone can dispute the reported numbers, and finally resolution occurs. Throughout this process, you receive updates showing each phase transition.

When resolution completes, your portfolio shows settled positions ready for redemption. If you held winning tokens, you click the redeem button and receive a payout based on the actual welfare metric values. If your prediction proved incorrect, those tokens hold no value, and you experience the natural consequence of market participation.

This cycle of information gathering, position taking, monitoring, and settlement forms the core rhythm of ClearPath participation. Over time, you develop intuition about proposal quality, market efficiency, and the factors that drive welfare metrics.

### Submitting Your Own Proposal

Eventually you might identify an opportunity the DAO should pursue. The proposal submission interface requires careful thought about every detail. You need to articulate your idea clearly, justify the requested funding, select the appropriate welfare metric for evaluation, and define milestones that demonstrate progress.

The 50 ETC bond requirement ensures you submit seriously considered proposals. This bond returns when your proposal resolves, providing incentive for good faith participation without creating permanent barriers to entry.

As you write, you think about how others will evaluate your proposal. What evidence supports your claims? Why should this particular welfare metric serve as the success measure? What risks exist, and how will you mitigate them? The template guides you through these considerations, helping you construct a compelling case.

After submitting, your proposal enters a review period. Community members examine your idea, ask questions, and discuss its merits. You engage with this feedback, clarifying points of confusion and addressing concerns. This period builds understanding before markets open.

When trading begins, you watch as prices evolve. You can trade on your own proposal if you wish, though you consider how others might perceive this action. The market aggregates diverse perspectives, and you learn from watching how collective intelligence evaluates your idea differently than you might have alone.

### Participating in Governance Beyond Trading

ClearPath offers other ways to contribute. You can vote on welfare metrics themselves, shaping what the DAO considers success. You might serve as an oracle reporter, posting a bond to submit verified welfare metric values after proposals execute. If you spot incorrect oracle reports, you can challenge them with evidence and a larger bond, escalating to formal arbitration if needed.

The ragequit mechanism provides a safety valve. If a proposal passes that you fundamentally oppose, you can exit with your proportional treasury share during the timelock period. This minority protection ensures the governance system cannot force participation in decisions you find unacceptable.

Over time, these various roles interweave. You might trade on some proposals, submit others, report oracle values occasionally, and participate in welfare metric governance. Each role offers different perspectives on how the system functions and how collective intelligence emerges from market mechanisms.

## The FairWins Experience: Creating and Trading Markets

### Discovering Open Markets

FairWins greets you with a different atmosphere. Rather than formal proposals moving through governance stages, you find diverse prediction markets created by individuals like yourself. Topics range from event outcomes to financial forecasts to community sentiment tracking.

Browsing available markets, you notice each shows the creator's resolution criteria clearly stated upfront. Unlike ClearPath where welfare metrics provide objective standards, FairWins relies on creators to define success clearly and resolve markets fairly. This flexibility enables markets on any topic, though it requires trust in creator integrity.

The market mechanics feel familiar if you used ClearPath. YES and NO tokens replace PASS and FAIL, but the underlying conditional token system works identically. Prices still reflect aggregate beliefs, LMSR still provides automated liquidity, and privacy protection still encrypts positions.

### Trading on Existing Markets

You find a market asking whether a particular event will occur by a specific date. The creator provided detailed resolution criteria, evidence sources, and a timeline. Current prices suggest a 40% probability, but your research leads you to believe the actual likelihood exceeds 50%.

You buy YES tokens, watching as your position encrypts automatically. The privacy protection matters less in FairWins than ClearPath since governance implications are absent, but it still prevents front-running and market manipulation based on identifying large traders.

As the event date approaches, you monitor developments. New information might lead you to adjust your position, buying more tokens if conviction strengthens or exiting early if doubts emerge. The ability to trade continuously until resolution provides flexibility traditional prediction markets often lack.

When the event occurs (or doesn't), the market creator submits resolution evidence. A challenge period allows community verification before finalization. If resolution proceeds smoothly, you redeem winning tokens. If disputes arise, you observe how the escalation mechanism handles disagreements.

### Creating Your Own Market

Perhaps you notice a question others might find interesting but no existing market addresses. The market creation interface walks you through defining your prediction precisely.

You craft a clear question with unambiguous resolution criteria. Vague questions lead to disputes, so you think carefully about edge cases. What counts as success? What sources will provide verification? When exactly does resolution occur? The more precisely you define these elements, the more confident traders will feel participating.

Initial liquidity requirements ensure your market can function. You stake a creator bond that returns after proper resolution, aligning your incentives with fair outcomes. You select a trading period long enough for information to emerge but short enough that traders don't lose interest.

Once created, your market appears in the FairWins marketplace. You might share it with interested communities, encouraging participation. As trading begins, you watch market prices evolve, potentially gaining insights from how others evaluate the question you posed.

Your role as creator comes with responsibility. When resolution time arrives, you must submit accurate outcome evidence. The challenge mechanism holds you accountable, but your reputation ultimately depends on fair dealing. Markets you resolve honestly build trust; disputed resolutions damage credibility for future markets you might create.

## Understanding the Complete User Flow

### The Information Journey

Both platforms reward information gathering. Before trading, successful participants research proposals or prediction questions thoroughly. They consider multiple perspectives, examine evidence, and form independent judgments about likely outcomes.

This research might involve reviewing technical specifications, evaluating team credentials, analyzing historical data, consulting domain experts, or studying market psychology. The most valuable information often comes from sources others overlook or synthesis that connects disparate facts.

The privacy protection becomes crucial here. If others could see your positions, they might infer your information sources or imitate your strategy without doing the research. Encrypted positions ensure your work generates returns proportional to its quality rather than being immediately copied.

### The Decision Process

Choosing to trade requires weighing multiple factors. How confident do you feel in your analysis? How much capital should you risk? What time horizon makes sense? Does current pricing offer value given your beliefs?

These decisions happen continuously as markets evolve. New information might strengthen or weaken your initial thesis. Other traders' actions (visible only through price movements) might signal information you missed. The dynamic nature of prediction markets means staying engaged throughout the trading period.

The interface helps by showing unrealized profit and loss, position sizes, market statistics, and time remaining. These metrics inform without overwhelming, letting you maintain awareness while focusing on the fundamental question of whether your prediction seems correct.

### The Social Dimension

While positions remain private, prediction markets exist within social contexts. Discussions happen in community channels where participants share analysis (though not necessarily positions). Proposal creators engage with questions. Market creators clarify resolution criteria.

These social interactions enrich the experience beyond pure trading. You learn from others' perspectives, discover information sources you hadn't considered, and contribute your own insights to collective understanding. The combination of private positions with public discussion creates an environment where information flows freely without enabling manipulation.

### The Learning Loop

Each completed market cycle teaches lessons. When your predictions prove correct, you gain confidence in your analytical methods. When markets move against you, you examine where your reasoning failed. Over time, this feedback loop develops better judgment about proposal quality, event likelihood, and market efficiency.

The system's futarchy foundation means trading generates not just personal returns but collective intelligence. Markets that accurately predict outcomes help the DAO make better decisions in ClearPath. Markets that forecast events correctly provide valuable signals in FairWins. Your participation contributes to these broader purposes while pursuing individual goals.

## Advanced User Scenarios

### Managing Complex Portfolios

As you become more experienced, you might hold positions across multiple markets simultaneously. The portfolio view becomes essential for tracking overall exposure, identifying concentration risks, and planning position adjustments.

Some markets might correlate: proposals targeting similar welfare metrics, events with common underlying factors, or related questions in different timeframes. Understanding these correlations helps manage risk and identify arbitrage opportunities where prices seem inconsistent across related markets.

The batched trading features let you execute multiple trades efficiently, reducing gas costs while maintaining privacy. You plan your trading around batch epochs, timing entries and exits to minimize both transaction costs and price impact.

### Developing Specialization

Over time you might develop expertise in particular domains. Perhaps you excel at evaluating technical proposals in ClearPath, or you become known for creating well-designed markets in FairWins. This specialization lets you focus where you add most value.

Your reputation matters more in some contexts than others. FairWins market creators benefit from track records of fair resolution. ClearPath proposal submitters gain credibility through past successes. Oracle reporters and challengers build reputations for accuracy. These informal reputation systems emerge from participant behavior rather than being explicitly encoded.

### Utilizing Advanced Privacy Features

The key-change capability offers protection beyond basic position encryption. If you suspect someone might attempt vote buying (offering to pay for verifiable support), changing your key invalidates any previous commitments you might have made. This MACI-inspired feature prevents coercion while maintaining privacy.

You might use key changes strategically when participating in especially contentious proposals where social pressure feels intense. The ability to credibly claim your voting position could change at any moment makes attempts at influencing you less appealing to potential manipulators.

## Connecting the User Experience to System Goals

### Building Collective Intelligence

Every trade you make adds information to market prices. When you buy YES tokens because of research others haven't done, prices adjust to reflect your knowledge. When you sell NO tokens because you spotted a flaw, prices correct accordingly. This aggregation mechanism transforms individual insights into collective predictions.

The futarchy goal of better governance emerges from this process. Proposals that truly will improve welfare metrics attract PASS token buyers, pushing prices higher and increasing execution likelihood. Proposals with hidden flaws see FAIL token accumulation from skeptical traders who spot problems. The DAO benefits from distributed analysis rather than relying on central planning.

### Maintaining Privacy While Creating Transparency

The system balances seemingly contradictory goals: individual privacy with collective transparency. You cannot see others' positions, yet you can verify that markets function correctly. Positions stay encrypted, yet settlement proceeds fairly based on clear outcomes. Zero-knowledge proofs and conditional tokens make this balance possible.

This architecture matters for user experience because it lets you trade honestly without fear of front-running, vote buying, or social punishment for unpopular positions. The privacy protection enables the transparency that markets need to function as information aggregation mechanisms.

### Supporting Both Institutional and Open Contexts

ClearPath and FairWins demonstrate how the same technical infrastructure can serve different social contexts. The formal governance of ClearPath with its welfare metrics, proposal lifecycle, and institutional safeguards contrasts with FairWins' open marketplace where anyone can create markets on any topic.

Your journey through one platform or the other (or both) reflects these different contexts. The experience adapts to your needs while maintaining consistent underlying mechanics. You learn the market system once, then apply that knowledge in whichever context serves your goals.

## Navigating Common User Challenges

### Understanding Complex Market States

Sometimes markets enter unexpected states. A proposal might be challenged, causing delays in resolution. A market creator might fail to resolve promptly, requiring community escalation. Oracle reports might contradict expectations, sparking disputes.

The interface helps you navigate these situations by clearly showing current state and available actions. If a proposal enters UMA escalation, you see the timeline and can follow the arbitration process. If a market creator fails to resolve, you understand what happens next and how long it might take.

These edge cases, while hopefully rare, form part of the complete user experience. The system provides mechanisms for handling them, but you need to understand that perfect execution isn't guaranteed and patience sometimes becomes necessary.

### Managing Gas Costs and Timing

Ethereum Classic transactions require gas fees that vary with network congestion. The user experience includes finding optimal times to trade when fees decrease, batching multiple actions to amortize costs, and deciding when speed justifies higher fees versus when patience makes sense.

The system helps by showing estimated gas costs before transactions and letting you adjust gas prices based on urgency. You learn over time when network congestion typically peaks and valleys, developing strategies for cost-effective participation.

### Interpreting Market Signals

Market prices convey information, but interpreting them requires nuance. A 70% price doesn't mean 70% probability in any pure sense; it means traders collectively behaved in ways producing that price given the LMSR mechanics and existing positions.

You learn to distinguish between strong market signals where high volume and consistent pricing suggest robust consensus versus weak signals where thin trading or volatile prices indicate uncertainty. This interpretation skill develops through experience and observation.

### Balancing Engagement With Life

The system doesn't require constant attention, but staying informed helps. You develop habits around how frequently to check positions, which proposals or markets warrant close monitoring, and when to step back and let markets run their course.

The notification features help by alerting you to important transitions: proposals entering resolution, markets approaching deadlines, positions becoming redeemable, or challenges being filed. You customize these notifications to maintain awareness without becoming overwhelmed.

## Concluding the Journey

Your path through Prediction DAO, whether via ClearPath's institutional governance or FairWins' open markets, forms a journey of learning and participation. You start by understanding the basics: how conditional tokens work, what privacy protection means, how markets aggregate information. You progress through actual participation: making trades, submitting proposals or creating markets, monitoring positions, and experiencing resolution.

Over time, these mechanics become second nature. You focus less on interface navigation and more on substantive questions: which proposals deserve support, what events seem likely, how welfare metrics might respond to different actions. The system fades into the background, enabling you to concentrate on the collective intelligence process it facilitates.

The platforms succeed when they feel less like complex technical systems and more like natural environments for expressing beliefs, sharing knowledge, and contributing to collective decisions. This documentation aimed to show that journey, walking through experiences as they unfold rather than listing features in isolation. Your actual path will vary based on interests, goals, and circumstances, but the fundamental flow of connecting, learning, participating, and contributing remains consistent across all users who engage with these prediction market platforms.
