# Security Testing Overview

ClearPath implements comprehensive automated security testing and analysis for all smart contracts. This section documents the security testing tools, methodologies, and CI/CD automation.

## Testing Layers

The security testing strategy includes multiple complementary approaches:

### 1. [Unit Testing](unit-testing.md)
Comprehensive test coverage using Hardhat with gas optimization and coverage reporting.

**What it tests:**
- Functional correctness of individual contract methods
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Access control and permissions
- Event emissions and state changes

### 2. [Static Analysis](static-analysis.md)
Automated vulnerability detection using Slither.

**What it tests:**
- Common vulnerability patterns (reentrancy, overflow, etc.)
- Code quality and best practices
- Optimization opportunities
- Dangerous constructs and anti-patterns

### 3. [Symbolic Execution](symbolic-execution.md)
Deep path exploration using Manticore.

**What it tests:**
- All possible execution paths
- Assertion violations
- Integer overflow/underflow conditions
- Complex multi-transaction scenarios

### 4. [Fuzz Testing](fuzz-testing.md)
Property-based testing using Medusa.

**What it tests:**
- Contract invariants under random inputs
- Unexpected behavior with edge case data
- State consistency across multiple operations
- Boundary violations and constraint breaking

## CI/CD Automation

All security tests run automatically via GitHub Actions on:

- Pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches
- Direct pushes to protected branches
- Weekly scheduled runs (Mondays at 00:00 UTC)
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Workflow:** [`.github/workflows/security-testing.yml`](https://github.com/chippr-robotics/prediction-dao-research/blob/main/.github/workflows/security-testing.yml)

## Test Results

All test results are:

- Uploaded as workflow artifacts (30-day retention)
- Summarized in the GitHub Actions UI
- Available for download and review

See the [CI/CD Configuration](ci-configuration.md) page for details on maintaining and updating the automation.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm test

# Run tests with gas reporting
npm run test:gas

# Run coverage analysis
npm run test:coverage

# Run Slither analysis
slither . --config-file slither.config.json

# Run Manticore symbolic execution
manticore contracts/ProposalRegistry.sol --contract ProposalRegistry --timeout 300

# Run Medusa fuzzing
medusa fuzz --timeout 300
```

## Security Best Practices

When developing smart contracts for ClearPath:

1. **Write comprehensive unit tests** for all new functionality
2. **Add property tests** for critical invariants
3. **Review static analysis results** before merging
4. **Fix high and medium severity issues** immediately
5. **Document security assumptions** in code comments
6. **Follow OpenZeppelin patterns** for common functionality
