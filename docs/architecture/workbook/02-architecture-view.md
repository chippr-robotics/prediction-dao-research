## Component decomposition

The platform is **five deployable units and one on-chain estate**, plus a
shared-package layer that exists specifically to stop duplication of things that
must not drift.

Read the diagram for what it *omits*: there is no arrow from the gateway to a
member's key, no arrow from the gateway into escrow, and no arrow from a
mini-app to anything but the host object. Those absences are the architecture.

### Unit responsibilities

| Unit | Language / runtime | Holds a key? | Optional? | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SPA** (`frontend/`) | React + Vite | Member keys, client-side only | No — it *is* the product | Every member surface; all signing; all direct chain reads |
| **Mini-app packages** (`frontend/miniapps/`) | Built separately, frozen at an immutable CID | No | Yes | Third-party/first-party apps executing inside the host object |
| **Capacitor shells** | iOS / Android native wrappers | Bridges to the platform authenticator | Yes | Native passkey ceremony, Ledger BLE, app lock, deep links |
| **relay-gateway** (`services/relay-gateway/`) | Node ESM | **No member key**; KMS-signs paymaster ops | Yes — every flow self-submits | Policy gateway: origin lock, identity tiering, screening, quotas, killswitch; read-proxy for vendors with no CORS; member API; x402 paywall |
| **OZ Relayer + redis** | Container | Platform gas key (KMS) | Yes | Submits relayed intents and pays their gas |
| **alto bundler** | Container, v1.2.7 | Per-chain executor EOA | Yes | ERC-4337 bundling, EntryPoint v0.6, **chain 137 only** |
| **MCP server** (`services/mcp-server/`) | Node, **dependency-free by policy** | No — cannot sign, cannot pay | Yes | Exposes the member API to the member's own agents |
| **FinOps exporter** (`services/finops-exporter/`) | Node | No — no signer, no write route | Yes | Prometheus metrics for every catalogued money path |
| **On-chain estate** | Solidity | Escrow itself | No | All value custody and settlement |

Two structural constraints explain more of the codebase than any design
document: the **24 KB contract code limit**, which is why `WagerRegistry` is two
facets behind one proxy sharing a single storage definition; and the fact that
`frontend/src` has ~2,966 extensionless imports while the gateway is Node ESM,
which is why shared code had to be extracted into `packages/` with explicit
`exports` before the EIP-712 tables could stop being duplicated.

## 0. Findings that matter before the tables

| # | Finding |
|---|---|
| F1 | 🔶 `resolveCredentialManager` (FE/lib/passkey/credentials.js:171) is **not exported** — it is module-private and reached only as the default of the `deps.credentials` parameter of `createCredential`/`getAssertion` (:334, :409). CLAUDE.md names it as the seam; the *enforced* seam is actually the two ceremony functions. Stronger than documented. |
| F2 | 🔶 Two whole subsystems have shipped seams that `CLAUDE.md` does not mention: **spec 106 gateway caller auth** (`GW/identity/`, `ROUTE_TABLE`) and **spec 107 keyed RPC access** (`GW/access/`, `FE/lib/network/issuedAccess.js`). Both are first-class trust/seam boundaries. |
| F3 | 🔶 `CLAUDE.md` states perps ships **no in-app execution (FR-018)**. Code contains a full **spec 083 position-management** path: `config/perps.js#perpsManageEnabled`/`perpsManageFeatureEnabled` (default OFF via `VITE_PERPS_MANAGE_ENABLED`), `hooks/usePerpsOrders.js`, `hooks/usePerpsTrade.js`, `lib/perps/venues/{gains,gmx}.js`, `lib/perps/attestation.js`. Read-only is now the *flag-off* state, not the only state. |
| F4 | 🔶 `CLAUDE.md` cites `specs/103-capacitor-channels/`; the directory on disk is **`specs/102-capacitor-channels/`** (colliding with `102-multisig-chain-abstraction`). `103-funding-pools` is correct. |
| F5 | 🔶 `scripts/secrets/registry.js:4` self-identifies as **spec 088**; `CLAUDE.md` attributes workstation secrets to spec 097. `specs/088-instant-acting-accounts` is a different feature. One of the two is a mis-citation. |
| F6 | `screeningChainIds()` lives in **`FE/lib/screening/sources.js:185`**, not in `config/networks.js` (where CLAUDE.md's list of chain-roster helpers otherwise sits). `isLocalOnlyChain` lives in **`config/contracts.js:560`**, also not `networks.js`. |
| F7 | Specs with no seam entry in CLAUDE.md at all: 086 account-cards, 088 instant-acting-accounts, 092 multi-chain-activity, 098 acting-account-purchase, 099 network-status-miniapp, 100 passkey-solana, 101 passkey-zcash, 106, 107. Code exists for 100 (`FE/lib/solana/`). |

Workspaces: `frontend`, `frontend/miniapps/*`, `services/relay-gateway`,
`services/finops-exporter`, `subgraph`, `tools/miniapp-build`, `packages/*`.
`services/mcp-server` is deliberately **NOT** a member (lockfile hazard) and has **no dependencies**.
`contracts/` is deliberately not a member.

| Package | Single source of truth for | Consumers (verified) | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|

|---|---|---|---|
| `GW/identity/` (`middleware.js`, `routeTable.js`, `resolve.js`, `tiers.js`, `quotaKey.js`, `upstreamCeiling.js`, `verifiers/{attestation,challenge,grant}.js`) **spec 106 — undocumented in CLAUDE.md** | `ROUTE_TABLE` is **THE ONE TABLE** of protected routes; **silence is a configuration error, not permission**; a challenge is a *metering upgrade*, never an access gate (every READ is `ANONYMOUS`); writes need `ADDRESS` (an answerable party), never `member` | a route absent from the table; putting a `human` minimum on a read; a second revocation store / membership reader | `services/relay-gateway/test/identity/` (asserts mounted set == declared set, **both directions**) |
| `GW/access/` (`routes.js`, `jwt.js`, `enforcement.js`) **spec 107 — undocumented** | Issuance of short-lived keyed-read credentials — **issues, never carries traffic**; every non-200 means "fall back to public capacity" | making the gateway an RPC passthrough; gating issuance above ANONYMOUS | `services/relay-gateway/test/access.test.js` |
| `GW/intent/` (`intentTypes.js` re-export, `verify.js`, `store.js`) | Signature recovery from the intent payload (self-authenticating); intent status store | a local type table; trusting a caller-supplied signer | `actionCoverage.test.js`, `gateway.test.js`, `test/intent/TypehashParity.test.js` |
| `GW/paymaster/` (`build.js`, `policy.js`, `sign.js`) | ERC-7677 sponsorship decision order: **killswitch → per-op ceilings → sanctions → deposit gate → quotas → KMS sign**; stub path never signs | signing before screening; refusing on an *unreadable* deposit (RPC blip ≠ empty pool) | `paymaster.test.js` |
| `GW/polymarket/` (`client.js`, `builderCode.js`, `normalize.js`, `routes.js`) | Builder-code attachment + fee caps (boot-fails above cap); read vs **write** quota split (write keyed by trader address) | hiding the additive taker fee; pooling write budget into reads | `polymarket.test.js` |
| `GW/perps/` (`client.js`, `normalize.js`, `routes.js`) | Per-venue failure isolation (`read`/`degraded`), `null` → "—", documented normalizer scale provenance; **no write routes** | rendering a degraded venue as zeros; adding execution here | `perps.test.js` |
| `GW/bitcoin/` (`client.js`, `cache.js`, `normalize.js`, `routes.js`) | Esplora reads + raw-tx broadcast + Stamps recognition; fail-safe stamp handling; 256kb body exception for the tx route | spending an unverified-stamp-free UTXO; seeing key material (gateway sees addresses + signed raw tx only) | `bitcoin.test.js` |
| `GW/news/` (`client.js`, `normalize.js`, `routes.js`) | TTL clamp **≥ 300 s**, single-flight per slug, serve-stale ≤ 10×TTL then `unreadable`; honest-empty `read` with `items: []`; vendor `image`/`icon`/HTML never forwarded | stale-as-live; forwarding vendor markup | `news.test.js` |
| `GW/memberApi/` (`contract.js` **= ROUTES/SCOPES/ERROR_CODES**, `auth.js`, `routes.js`, `openapi.js`, `membership.js`, `wagers.js`, `intents.js`, `assistant.js`, `revocation.js`) | `contract.js` is the ONE route/scope/error table — `routes.js` mounts **by contract id** and **boot-fails** on a declared-but-unmounted route (routes.js:579-588); `auth_unverifiable`/`membership_unreadable` are retryable 503s, never denials; no `write:` scope exists | typing a path in `routes.js`; a scope that authorises a write; an actor other than the token account | `memberApi.test.js` (probes every ROUTES entry over HTTP), `memberApiAuth.test.js`, `memberApiQuotaIsolation.test.js`, `memberApiSpend.test.js` |
| `GW/x402/` (`paywall.js`, `requirements.js`, `verify.js`, `settle.js`) | Pay-per-request rail: **bearer token checked first** so a member never reaches the paywall; `TransferWithAuthorization` (not `Receive…`); token's own EIP-712 domain from `chains.js#tokenDomain`; verify-everything-before-settle; engine outage ⇒ `503 settlement_unavailable` | a free serve on engine outage; a new key/facilitator; a 1271 check for a contract payer (EOA-only, reason says so) | `x402.test.js` |
| `GW/fees/onchain.js` | The gateway's **read-only** FeeRouter view; env bps are fallback only | a second fee-config store; a hardcoded bps | `fees.test.js` |
| `GW/policy/` (`killswitch.js`, `quotas.js`, `sanctions.js`, `dedup.js`, `backpressure.js`, `reload.js`) | Global + per-module killswitch; quota windows (per-signer + global); **fail-closed** sanctions screen; SIGHUP live config reload (read via live getters, not captured booleans) | screening after signing; a captured boolean that survives a reload | `rateLimit.test.js`, `gateway.test.js` |
| `GW/engine/client.js` | The **one** adapter to the OZ relayer engine (`POST /api/v1/relayers/{id}/transactions`); swappable | a second submission rail; policy in the engine | `gateway.test.js` |
| `GW/audit/log.js`, `GW/metrics/counters.js` | Audit fields (never message content, never key material) and bounded metric labels | unbounded labels (address/tx hash) | `memberApiSpend.test.js` (counts only) |
| `GW/config/index.js`, `GW/config/chains.js`, `GW/config/providers.js` | All env parsing + upstream base URLs + per-chain provider construction + `tokenDomain`; **boot fails loudly** on an out-of-cap fee or bad URL | reading `process.env` in a module | `tenant.test.js`, `rpcEndpoints.test.js` |

| B1 | **Browser → gateway (edge)** | every `/v1/*` call | Cloudflare Transform Rule injects `X-Origin-Auth`; gateway timing-safe compares and answers `403 origin_denied`; exempt only `/healthz`, `/status`, `/v1/engine/webhook` (server.js:248-261). CORS allow-list incl. native shell origins `capacitor://localhost` + `https://localhost` (config/index.js:442) |
| B2 | **Browser → gateway (caller identity)** | tier claim | spec 106 `GW/identity/middleware.js` + `ROUTE_TABLE`: **absence from the table is a configuration error, not permission**; reads are `ANONYMOUS` (tier buys throughput), writes/signing need `ADDRESS`. Test asserts mounted==declared both directions |
| B3 | **Member → gateway (capability)** | member-signed `fw1` grant | `GW/memberApi/auth.js` verifies the off-chain EIP-712 `ApiKeyGrant` (one source: `@fairwins/intent-types/offchain`); scopes from `contract.js`; TTL-capped; revocation in-process and **disclosed as non-durable**; three verdicts — `auth_unverifiable`/`membership_unreadable` are **retryable 503s, never denials** |
| B4 | **Unauthenticated agent → gateway (payment)** | `X-PAYMENT` EIP-3009 authorization | `GW/x402/`: bearer token checked **first** (a member never reaches the paywall); verify-everything-before-settle; sanctions fail-closed on the payer; served **as the payer**; EOA-only with a reason; `0` price = not offered, never free |
| B5 | **Gateway → vendor** | platform credentials, builder code, referral ids | Credentials are gateway-only env from Secret Manager; per-module quotas + `withUpstreamCeiling`; killswitch; `GW/config/index.js` **boot-fails** on an out-of-cap fee; Hyperliquid builder hard-capped at 10 bps |
| B6 | **Gateway → engine (submission)** | tx calldata | `GW/engine/client.js` is the only adapter; per-chain relayer id; **one executor key per chain, never shared**; all policy stays in the gateway |
| B7 | **Engine → gateway (callback)** | status webhook | HMAC-SHA256 `X-Signature` over the **exact raw bytes** (`req.rawBody`), timing-safe, **fail closed** (no secret / no header / mismatch ⇒ nothing accepted) |
| B8 | **Host → mini-app package (untrusted third-party code)** | the `host` object only | (a) on-chain curation + **`launchable`** (never `status`) + content-committed `approveApp(id, expectedManifestHash)` reverting `StaleProposal`; (b) integrity: keccak(manifest bytes) vs chain + sha256 of **every executed/injected byte**, re-checked after cache *and* network; (c) `blob:` in `script-src` only, never `https:`; (d) the host object is wrappers-only — sanctions screening happens **inside `wallet.submit`** before any rail; `contracts(name)` **throws** for an undeclared name; `readProvider` cached for stable identity; (e) `FE/test/miniapps/packageBoundary.test.js` enforces the import boundary both ways; (f) `virtual:tenant` + the preset's `envPrefix` make a bundled host config a hard build failure |
| B9 | **Member → vault (Safe multisig)** | proposals, approvals, executions | `SafePolicyGuard` / `SafePolicyGuardV2` are **deliberately not upgradeable**; migration is vault-consented `setGuard`; **no matching rule ⇒ denial**; approvers verified against the vault's own `approvedHashes` at `nonce()-1` and only while still owners; client-side `matchPreview` is a twin that must move in lockstep; `resolveWriteRail` states an unavailable rail before the tap; signing a message is **refused** while operating as a vault |
| B10 | **Member's device → key material** | private keys, seeds, RPC/API credentials | Legacy secrets AES-GCM under PBKDF2-650k, **only ciphertext persisted**; passkey seeds PRF-wrapped; hardware store holds public metadata only; every credential store is **deliberately absent from `syncedObjects.js`** with a test asserting it; redaction at every display/log boundary (`redactRpcUrl`, `sk-…`+4) |
| B11 | **CI → cloud** | Terraform plan/apply, image push | IAM **additive only** (`_iam_member`; `_binding`/`_policy` rejected by `npm run check:iac` **and** the CI identity lacks `projectIamAdmin` — two layers); never a `secret_version` in state; adoption by `import` with `prevent_destroy` on unrecoverable resources; Terraform owns Cloud Run **shape** with a gate-enforced `ignore_changes`, Cloud Build owns the **image**; apply executes the *reviewed* plan, gated on the infra-tree digest; modules SHA-pinned from the private `chippr-tf-modules` |
| B12 | **Workstation → production** | funded deploy keys with live admin authority | `scripts/secrets/registry.js` is the only inventory; `npm run sec -- --profile <p>` delivers a least-privilege bundle and nothing else; **KEY/PASSWORD material never falls back to `process.env` on a public network**; never written to disk/argv/log; operators **impersonate** a Terraform-declared SA (no key file), `serviceAccountTokenCreator` granted on the **account**, never the project; `check:env-hygiene` + `npm run test:secrets` gate drift; `VITE_*` reported as a NOTE (public by construction) |
| B13 | **Public internet → node interiors** | SSH | **no public `:22`** — open to the IAP range only; Ansible tunnels through IAP; widening the firewall is forbidden |
| B14 | **Cohort boundary (testnet ↔ mainnet)** | chain ids | `cohortChainIds()` / `isInCohort` / `assertReferenceChainInCohort()`; constitution III forbids reads crossing it; `miniAppChainId()` deliberately does not derive from `TESTNET_CHAIN_ID` |
| B15 | **EVM ↔ non-EVM** | chain identifiers | `isBitcoinNetworkId` (string ids), `isEvmPerpVenue` (Hyperliquid `chainId: null`), Solana derivation kept out of EVM seams |
| B16 | **Member ↔ GutterToken (BYOK)** | the member's own API key and messages | Architectural: the **browser** calls `api.guttertokens.com` directly — FairWins never holds/forwards/sees the key or a message, charges nothing, and **may not render a rate or credit figure**. Legal amended in place (privacy §2/§5: GutterToken is not our processor) |
| B17 | **Assistant tool results ↔ app actions** | counterparty-authored text (prompt injection) | No `build_intent` and no `navigate` in the in-app assistant; a tool result never makes the app DO anything; `replyLinks.js` is the only path from model text to a click; `find_in_app` is descriptive over the nav index; gateway **refuses client-supplied `tools`** |
