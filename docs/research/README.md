# Research Documents

This directory contains in-depth research and analysis documents for proposed enhancements and integrations to the Prediction DAO platform.

## Available Research

### [GutterToken Assistant Integration](guttertoken-assistant-integration.md)

**Status**: Evaluation - Input to a feature spec  
**Date**: September 5, 2026

Evaluates how FairWins members could run the spec-095 assistant on their own GutterToken prepaid
credits, as an alternative to the members-only FairWins-funded rail. Measures what the GutterToken
API actually offers (open CORS, bearer keys, no account or balance endpoint, no delegated auth),
compares bring-your-own-key browser-direct, gateway passthrough, a FairWins-owned account, and a
mini-app, and recommends the browser-direct pattern surfaced through the existing bottom sheets.

### [Dex v3 Integration Analysis](dex-v3-integration-analysis.md)

**Status**: Final - Ready for Review  
**Date**: December 23, 2025

A comprehensive analysis exploring the integration of Dex v3 (Uniswap v3 fork) concentrated liquidity mechanics into Prediction DAO. This research document covers:

- **Architecture Analysis**: Deep dive into V3's concentrated liquidity mechanisms, tick mathematics, and fee structures
- **Comparative Study**: Detailed comparison between current LMSR markets and V3 AMM approaches
- **Integration Strategy**: Platform-specific approach with clear rationale
- **Technical Design**: Proposed smart contract architecture and implementation details
- **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive analysis of technical, economic, and operational risks
- **Implementation Roadmap**: Phased rollout plan for FairWins V3 integration

**Key Recommendation**: Platform-specific approach where ClearPath uses LMSR with Nightmarket privacy for governance (privacy-first), and FairWins uses V3 concentrated liquidity for prediction markets (efficiency-first).

### [Alternative Approaches (Appendix)](dex-v3-alternative-approaches.md)

**Status**: Reference Material  
**Date**: December 23, 2025

Detailed documentation of four alternative integration approaches that were evaluated but not recommended. Includes:

- **Option 2**: Parallel Markets (both mechanisms on both platforms)
- **Option 3**: Hybrid Model (LMSR base with V3 supplementary)
- **Option 4**: Specialized Markets (mechanism by market type)
- **Option 5**: Post-Resolution Secondary Market (V3 for resolved tokens)

Each option includes concept, architecture diagrams, advantages, disadvantages, and rationale for why it wasn't selected. Useful for understanding the decision-making process and future reconsideration scenarios.
