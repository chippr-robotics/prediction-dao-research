# Infrastructure as Code

**Spec**: [085-infrastructure-as-code](https://github.com/chippr-robotics/prediction-dao-research/tree/main/specs/085-infrastructure-as-code) · **Issue**: #1177

The FairWins cloud estate is described declaratively: **Terraform** provisions cloud resources,
**Ansible** converges node interiors. The goal is that the environment can be reconstructed or
audited from repository contents alone — no manual console changes, no undocumented drift.

## Read this first

Three facts shape every decision here. Each has already caused, or nearly caused, a real incident.

### 1. The GCP project is shared

`chippr-bots-site-wp` hosts a public WordPress VM on the default network, plus `clearpath-*`,
`fukuii-*` and `kings-edge-*`. Nothing in this repository may describe, reference, or authoritatively
overwrite anything outside its own inventory.

The concrete trap:

| Resource | Semantics | Effect here |
|---|---|---|
| `google_project_iam_member` | additive — one (role, member) pair | safe |
| `google_project_iam_binding` | **authoritative for that role** | strips the role from every other principal, project-wide |
| `google_project_iam_policy` | **authoritative for the whole policy** | removes every grant not declared here, including the owners' own |

The names differ by one word and the resulting plan diff looks small and ordinary. Under automatic
apply, nobody has to click anything for it to happen. `npm run check:iac` rejects both
authoritative forms (G-01, G-02), and the CI identity is not granted project IAM admin so the same
mistake also fails at the API. Two layers, because either alone has a way to be wrong.

### 2. Some resources cannot be recreated

KMS key versions, secret payloads, and the static IPs pinned in Cloudflare DNS. These carry
`prevent_destroy` **and** sit outside the CI identity's permissions. `prevent_destroy` is a
configuration guard — a change that deletes the resource block deletes the guard with it — so the
permission layer is what holds in that case.

### 3. One service must stay decommissioned

`cloudbuild.yaml` no longer builds or deploys the Cloud Run alto bundler. That deletion is
load-bearing: re-arming it alongside the VM bundler puts **two executors on one EOA** — colliding
nonces, stuck bundles, both instances reporting healthy, and no in-band detection.
`single-alto-gate.sh` detects the condition within 60s and refuses to start the VM's alto, but it
cannot prevent it. Guardrail G-11 rejects any attempt to declare the service.

## Layout

```
infra/terraform/
  bootstrap/                 run-once trust root. Local state, committed. Not in the apply workflow.
  modules/                   network, edge-node, cloud-run-service, cloudflare-zone, monitoring
  environments/prod/         state prefix: prod
  environments/staging/      state prefix: staging
infra/ansible/               roles, playbooks, dynamic inventory over IAP
scripts/infra/               the guardrail gate, the plan renderer, the prober generator
.github/workflows/           infra-plan.yml, infra-apply.yml, infra-drift.yml
```

One root per environment, separate state prefixes: a prod apply cannot reach staging state at all.
That is a harder boundary than `-target`, which applies a subgraph without refreshing the rest and
so leaves recorded state no longer describing reality (guardrail G-14 rejects it).

## Who owns what

Every managed attribute has exactly **one** owner. Two owners on one attribute produces permanent
false drift, and false drift is how real drift gets ignored.

| Attribute class | Owner |
|---|---|
| VPC, subnet, firewall rules, static IPs | Terraform |
| VM existence, machine type, labels, tags, attached SA, shielded settings | Terraform |
| Packages, OS hardening, nginx config, systemd units, container stack, runtime secrets | Ansible |
| Cloud Run scaling, CPU, ingress, SA, secret wiring, invoker IAM, domain mapping | Terraform |
| Cloud Run **image tag and revision** | **Cloud Build** |
| Secret containers + access bindings | Terraform |
| Secret **payloads and rotation** | out of band |
| KMS rings, keys, IAM | Terraform |
| KMS **key versions** | out of band — never managed |
| DNS, WAF ruleset, transform ruleset | Terraform |
| Monitoring channels, checks, policies, log metrics | Terraform |

Full table with rationale: `specs/085-infrastructure-as-code/contracts/ownership-boundary.md`.

## Tooling

Terraform and Ansible are not part of the npm toolchain — install them separately.

```bash
# Terraform 1.15.x
curl -fsSL -o tf.zip https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.15.8/terraform_1.15.8_linux_amd64.zip
unzip tf.zip && sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/

# Ansible
pip install ansible-core ansible-lint
cd infra/ansible && ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
```

`npm run check:iac` needs only Node, so the guardrail gate runs anywhere.

## Everyday tasks

### Change a service's configuration

1. Edit the relevant module call in `infra/terraform/environments/<env>/main.tf`.
2. Open a PR. `infra-plan.yml` posts a redacted plan summary showing the blast radius, with
   replacements called out separately from in-place updates.
3. Merge. `infra-apply.yml` applies **the plan that was reviewed** — not a fresh one.

### Add a resource

Declare it in the appropriate module (or add a module), then:

```bash
npm run check:iac
terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/environments/prod fmt -check
terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/environments/prod validate
```

If the resource already exists in the cloud, add an `import` block instead of letting Terraform
create a second one — see below.

### Adopt an existing resource

```hcl
import {
  to = module.network.google_compute_address.origin["fairwins-gateway-ip"]
  id = "projects/chippr-bots-site-wp/regions/us-central1/addresses/fairwins-gateway-ip"
}
```

Then:

```bash
terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated.tf   # a STARTING POINT, never committed raw
# review, reshape into the module, delete generated.tf
terraform plan          # must say "will be imported", never "must be replaced"
terraform apply
terraform plan          # must say "No changes."
```

**The last step is the definition of done.** If the plan is not clean, the *configuration* is wrong
— fix it in the repository. Never apply to force live infrastructure to match a generated body.

`import` blocks stay in the repository after adoption. They are the audit record of how each
resource came under management, and the recovery path if state is ever lost.

### Converge a node

```bash
cd infra/ansible
ansible-playbook site.yml --check --diff   # dry run
ansible-playbook site.yml                  # both nodes, one at a time
```

The nodes have **no public SSH** — the inventory tunnels through IAP. If a playbook cannot connect,
fix the tunnel, never the firewall.

A second consecutive run must report `changed=0`. If it does not, something in a role is
non-idempotent — usually `state: latest` or a `shell` task without a truthful `changed_when`.

## Secrets

Terraform manages secret **containers** and who may read them. It never manages payloads: a
`google_secret_manager_secret_version` resource writes the value into state in plaintext, and
guardrail G-04 rejects it.

There is **one accepted exception**, documented rather than hidden: the origin-lock header value is
read through a `google_secret_manager_secret_version` *data source* so the Cloudflare transform rule
and the origin nginx carry the same value. Data-source results *are* written to state —
`sensitive = true` hides a value from output, not from state. The alternative was a placeholder plus
a manual dashboard step, which reintroduces exactly the drift this feature removes. The gate warns
on every data-source use so the exception stays countable.

## Gates

| Gate | Proves |
|---|---|
| `npm run check:iac` | the fifteen repository-specific rules in `contracts/guardrails.md` |
| `npm run test:iac-guardrails` | that each rule still fires — a gate that passes everything gets cited as evidence |
| `terraform fmt -check` / `validate` | syntax and provider schema |
| `tflint` | invalid arguments, deprecated usage, dead declarations |
| `ansible-lint` + syntax check | playbook correctness |
| double-run idempotency | a converge run changes nothing the second time |
| scheduled drift | the running estate still matches the repository |

All fail the pipeline on error. `continue-on-error` is forbidden on them (constitution IV).

## Shared modules

Modules live in **[`chippr-robotics/chippr-tf-modules`](https://github.com/chippr-robotics/chippr-tf-modules)**
(private) and are consumed by pinned commit SHA:

```hcl
source = "git::https://github.com/chippr-robotics/chippr-tf-modules.git//modules/network?ref=70498e2a2860f2e65cd2ce3919ca85d29678a1e3"
```

A SHA rather than a tag, because a tag can be repointed and a commit cannot. Guardrail **G-16**
rejects any external module source that is unpinned or pinned to a branch.

Because the repo is private, `terraform init` needs a credential — the workflows rewrite git's config
with `TF_MODULES_TOKEN` before `init`. A missing token shows up as `repository not found`, not as a
permission error, because GitHub returns 404 for private repos the caller cannot see.

**Add new modules there, not to `infra/terraform/modules/`.** A module kept locally is invisible to
the other Chippr projects sharing this estate and drifts from its shared twin. That directory now
holds only a pointer.
