# Active Build Documentation

This directory contains documentation for ongoing implementation work, technical specifications, and system design documents that are actively being built or updated.

## Contents

### Scalability Architecture
- **[scalability-architecture.md](./scalability-architecture.md)** - Complete scalability design including batch processing, event structures, query APIs, gas optimization, and implementation roadmap

### Implementation Tracking
- **[scalability-implementation.md](./scalability-implementation.md)** - Current implementation status, results, and phase completion for the scalability architecture

## Purpose

This directory is for:
- **Technical specifications** currently being implemented
- **Design documents** for features in active development
- **Implementation roadmaps** with phase tracking
- **Architecture designs** before they become formal ADRs

## Related Documentation

- **ADRs** ([docs/adr/](../adr/)) - Finalized architectural decisions
- **Runbooks** ([docs/runbooks/](../runbooks/)) - Operational procedures and integration guides
- **Developer Guide** ([docs/developer-guide/](../developer-guide/)) - Setup and development workflows

## Contributing

When working on active implementations:
1. Create or update documentation in this directory
2. Include implementation status and phase tracking
3. Link to related ADRs if the work implements an architectural decision
4. Move completed designs to appropriate final locations
5. Update this README when adding new documents
