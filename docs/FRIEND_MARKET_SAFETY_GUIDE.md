# Friend Group Market Safety Guide

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT SAFETY WARNINGS

### Smart Contract Risks

**READ CAREFULLY BEFORE CREATING OR PARTICIPATING IN FRIEND MARKETS**

When you create or join a friend group prediction market, you are interacting with a smart contract on the blockchain. It is critical that you understand the following:

### 1. **No One Controls the Outcome**

- **Neither you, your friends, nor FairWins can control or reverse the outcome** of a smart contract once it's deployed
- The contract operates autonomously based on the code and oracle results
- **This is irreversible** - funds sent to smart contracts cannot be recovered except through the normal resolution process
- **Smart contracts are permanent** - they cannot be deleted or "taken back"

### 2. **You Are Responsible**

- **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK** - You are solely responsible for:
  - Verifying who you are betting with
  - Understanding the bet terms
  - Ensuring the arbitrator (if any) is trustworthy
  - Reading and understanding the contract parameters
- **Do your due diligence** before committing funds
- **Start with small amounts** until you trust the system

### 3. **This Is Real Money**

- All bets use real cryptocurrency (ETH/ETC)
- **You can lose all funds you commit**  
- Only bet what you can afford to lose
- Friend markets are not FDIC insured or backed by any institution

### 4. **Arbitration Limits**

While friend markets support optional arbitrators:
- **Arbitrators are chosen by you** - not vetted by FairWins
- Arbitrators may be biased, unavailable, or dishonest
- **No legal recourse** if arbitration goes wrong
- For important bets, consider using:
  - Public markets with established oracles
  - Pegged markets that settle based on public outcomes
  - Multiple trusted arbitrators

## 🚨 How to Spot Scams

Friend markets open new possibilities but also new risks. Here's how to protect yourself:

### Red Flags - DO NOT PARTICIPATE if you see these:

#### ❌ Suspicious Participants
- **Unknown addresses** - Don't bet with people you can't identify
- **New accounts** - Be wary of accounts with no history
- **Pressure tactics** - "Act now!" or "Limited time!" are manipulation
- **Too good to be true** - If odds seem unrealistic, they probably are

#### ❌ Bad Market Setup
- **Vague terms** - Resolution criteria must be crystal clear
- **Unfair arbitrator** - Never use an arbitrator who:
  - Is one of the participants
  - Has a stake in the outcome
  - You don't know personally
  - Has a history of bias
- **No arbitrator when needed** - Complex bets need neutral resolution
- **Unrealistic pegging** - Market pegged to non-existent public markets

#### ❌ Communication Red Flags
- Contact only through DMs or off-platform
- Unwillingness to use public verified contracts  
- Requests to send funds outside the platform
- Promises of "guaranteed" returns
- Claims that someone else will "handle" the resolution

### Common Scam Patterns

#### 1. **The Fake Arbitrator Scam**
- Scammer creates market with their own address as "arbitrator"
- Outcome is predetermined in scammer's favor
- **Protection**: Never accept a participant as arbitrator

#### 2. **The Disappearing Act**
- After taking bets, the creator disappears
- No resolution ever happens
- **Protection**: Only bet with known, trusted friends

#### 3. **The Ambiguous Outcome**
- Market terms are intentionally vague
- Multiple interpretations possible
- Scammer argues for favorable interpretation
- **Protection**: Insist on crystal-clear, objective resolution criteria

#### 4. **The Pump and Dump**
- Create excitement around a market
- Get others to add liquidity
- Manipulate or abandon the market
- **Protection**: Stick to small friend groups you know

#### 5. **The Sybil Attack**
- One person controls multiple accounts
- Pretends to be different "friends"
- Manipulates the market
- **Protection**: Verify identities through multiple channels

## ✅ Best Practices for Safe Friend Markets

### Before Creating a Market

1. **Know Your Participants**
   - Only create markets with people you know and trust in real life
   - Verify identities through video call, social media, or in-person
   - Use established reputation if available

2. **Define Clear Terms**
   - Write specific, measurable resolution criteria
   - Include exact dates and times
   - Define what evidence is acceptable
   - Example (Good): "Bitcoin closes above $50,000 on CoinMarketCap at 11:59 PM UTC on Dec 31, 2024"
   - Example (Bad): "Bitcoin will moon soon"

3. **Choose Arbitration Wisely**
   - For 1v1 bets, consider:
     - A mutual friend both parties trust
     - A public oracle/data source
     - Pegging to an established public market
   - For group bets:
     - Use consensus (majority rules)
     - Public data sources when possible
     - Established prediction markets

4. **Consider Market Pegging**
   - **Safest option**: Peg your friend market to a public market
   - Automatic settlement based on established oracle
   - No arbitrator needed
   - Resolution is transparent and verifiable
