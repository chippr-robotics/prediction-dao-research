# Operational Runbooks

This directory contains step-by-step operational guides, integration procedures, and runbooks for using and maintaining the platform.

## Contents

### Integration Guides
- **[batch-operations.md](./batch-operations.md)** - Complete integration guide for batch processing APIs with examples in JavaScript, Python, and React

## Purpose

Runbooks provide:
- **Step-by-step procedures** for common operations
- **Integration examples** with code samples
- **API usage guides** for developers
- **Troubleshooting procedures** for common issues
- **Deployment checklists** and operational procedures

## Structure

Each runbook should include:
1. **Overview** - What the procedure accomplishes
2. **Prerequisites** - Required setup and dependencies
3. **Step-by-Step Instructions** - Detailed procedures
4. **Code Examples** - Working sample code
5. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
6. **References** - Links to related documentation

- **Active Build** ([docs/active_build/](../active_build/)) - Current implementation work
- **Developer Guide** ([docs/developer-guide/](../developer-guide/)) - General development setup

## Contributing

When creating new runbooks:
1. Use clear, imperative language ("Do X", not "You should do X")
2. Include working code examples
3. Test all procedures before documenting
4. Keep procedures focused on a single task
5. Update this README when adding new runbooks
