# Changelog

**This file is generated.** Entries are written by `.github/workflows/release.yml` at release time
from the classifications carried on merged pull requests (spec 076). Do not hand-edit it — a
hand-written entry will be overwritten by the next release, and a hand-written version number is
rejected outright by the version gate.

Versions follow the scheme in
`specs/076-monorepo-semantic-versioning/contracts/version-scheme.md`, which defines what
"breaking" means in this repository rather than leaving it to judgment.

Release candidates (`vX.Y.Z-rc.N`) are cut from `staging` and are not recorded here; only published
production releases are.

## v1.5.1 — 2026-08-10

> **Consolidated record.** This entry covers the whole range **v1.2.5 → v1.5.1**, i.e. it also
> accounts for the commits released as v1.2.6, v1.2.7, v1.2.8, v1.2.9, v1.3.0, v1.3.1, v1.4.0,
> v1.4.1 and v1.4.2. Those tags exist and are immutable, but their individual release-record pull
> requests were never merged — each was branched from `main`, so they accumulated and conflicted
> with one another until the in-repo record was ten versions behind what had actually shipped.
> `.github/workflows/release.yml` now closes superseded records and derives its range from the
> CHANGELOG rather than the last tag, so a record can no longer be silently lost this way.
>
> One earlier entry could not be recovered: **v1.2.4** was tagged but its record was lost before
> this consolidation, and the commits it covered are folded into the v1.2.5 range above it.
