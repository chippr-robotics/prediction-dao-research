///         an immutable ERC-1167 clone by {WagerPoolFactory}. Members `join()` / `approve()` / `claim()`
///         with their real wallet; the payout matrix keys on the winner's public address (the address is
///         the "claim code"), so the creator builds the payout straight from the roster and every party
///         derives the same claim identity with no off-chain code exchange.
///
/// @dev    Timing mirrors the 1v1/oracle {WagerRegistry} so pools look and feel identical: two ABSOLUTE
///         deadlines seeded at init — `acceptDeadline` (joining/acceptance closes) and `resolveDeadline`
///         (resolution must complete by). Bounds + ordering are enforced by the factory
///         ({WagerPoolFactory._checkDeadlines}), matching `WagerRegistry`.
///
///         Relayer-ready (spec 035/036): every actor-attributed action has a `…WithSig` twin
///         ({approveWithSig}/{claimWithSig}/{proposeOutcomeWithSig}/{closeJoiningWithSig}/{cancelWithSig}/
///         {refundWithSig}) that authorizes the recovered EOA `signer` instead of `msg.sender`, so a
///         relayer can submit on the member's behalf. Because clones are IMMUTABLE, these are baked into
///         the template at deploy time. The money-in join has its own relayable form ({joinWithAuthorization},
///         EIP-3009). Self-submit entrypoints remain the primary path (FR-014).
///
///         Security posture: checks-effects-interactions + a reentrancy guard on every value-moving
///         path; the ONLY escrow exits are {claim} (Resolved) and {refund}/{cancel}; the creator cannot
///         force a payout (members approve to a fraction-of-joined threshold); the resolveDeadline refund
///         path guarantees funds are never stuck. The master calls `_disableInitializers()`; clones
///         initialize exactly once.
///
///         Payout-matrix trust model (for the security review): the resolved outcome is committed as a
///         `keccak256(entries)` hash at approve/lock time; the entries (winners + amounts) are revealed
///         only at {claim}. {claim} enforces `sum(entries) == escrowTotal` and per-INDEX single-claim, so
///         a matrix that sums to escrow is fully claimable even if the same winner appears in multiple
///         rows. A malformed *approved* matrix (sum != escrow, or a zero-address winner row) can strand
///         funds; that is inherent to the commit-hash design (members approve the off-chain-revealed
///         matrix, verified against this hash) and is unchanged from the prior design.
