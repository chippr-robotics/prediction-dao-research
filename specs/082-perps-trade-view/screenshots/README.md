# Perps view — visual review record (actor-critic loop)

Captured by `scripts/ui/capture-perps.mjs` against a stubbed gateway (fixture pairs/positions/
config — no live venue data), dev server at 1280×900 and 390×844, deviceScaleFactor 2.

| File | State |
|---|---|
| `perps-desktop-light.png` | Ready state, all venues healthy, light theme, desktop. Merged table + legend row, positions, fee + risk disclosures. |
| `perps-desktop-dark.png` | Same state, dark theme — badge/contrast check. |
| `perps-mobile-light.png` | Ready state at 390px — table scrolls inside its own container; page never scrolls horizontally. |
| `perps-mobile-dark.png` | Same at 390px, dark theme. |
| `perps-degraded-venue.png` | GMX degraded: named banner, GMX pairs absent (never stale-as-live), other venues render. |
| `perps-filters-open-mobile-light.png` | Market controls disclosed at 390px — venue pills + sort inside the panel. Viewport shot, not full-page: how much screen the controls cost before the first pair is the thing under review. |
| `perps-filters-open-mobile-dark.png` | Same, dark theme. |
| `perps-filter-active-collapsed-mobile-light.png` | A live venue filter with the panel CLOSED — the toggle names it and the result count is visible, so a short table is never unexplained. |
| `perps-filter-longest-summary-mobile-light.png` | The widest summary the toggle can carry (longest venue label + a non-default sort) on the narrowest viewport — the toolbar wraps rather than eating the search field. |

Critic findings fixed during the loop (each re-verified by re-capture):

1. **Venue badges unreadable in dark theme** — `--bg-tertiary` pill is light in dark mode →
   switched to a bordered transparent badge that inherits theme text color.
2. **Table clipped its last columns at desktop width** — header InfoTips + wide headers pushed
   `Max leverage`/`Trade ↗` past the container edge with no cue. Fixed by moving term InfoTips
   into a legend row under the table (the Earn convention), naming the funding interval in the
   header (`Funding / 1h`) instead of per cell, tightening cell padding, and shortening chain
   labels ("Arbitrum One" → "Arbitrum"). Verified: table width == container width at 1280.
3. **Forex precision loss** — EUR/USD 1.0841 rendered "1.08"; `formatPairPrice` now keeps up to
   4 decimals for 1 ≤ price < 100.

## Round 2 — market-control density (issue #1440)

The venue pills, the search box and the sort select were three stacked rows, and on a phone the
pills alone wrapped onto two. Together they took roughly a fifth of the viewport before a single
pair was on screen, on a surface whose entire job is the table under them. Search stays on the
toolbar; the venue filter and the sort moved behind a disclosure that is UNMOUNTED when closed.

Collapsing a filter is only safe if the closed control still says what is shaping the table — a
table quietly missing rows is indistinguishable from a venue that stopped reporting, which is the
confusion the rest of this view exists to avoid. So the toggle carries the active filter as a chip,
and the "showing N of M pairs" line (previously `sr-only` always) becomes visible the moment the
search box or the venue filter narrows the list.

Critic findings fixed during this round (each re-verified by re-capture):

4. **The search placeholder truncated mid-word once the toggle carried a filter chip.** The
   toolbar was a non-wrapping row, so the growing button was paid for out of the search field
   ("Search pairs (BTC, ET"). Fixed by letting the toolbar wrap and giving the search a floor of
   the width its own placeholder needs (12rem at 0.9rem). The row stays one line in every default
   state and drops the button to a second line only when a named filter makes the pair too wide —
   two lines beats a search box nobody can read.

Checked and unchanged: both themes at both viewports, no horizontal page scroll, every interactive
target ≥ 36px, the degraded-venue banner, and the desktop table still fitting its container.
