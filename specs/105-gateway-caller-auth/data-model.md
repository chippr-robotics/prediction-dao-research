# Data Model: Gateway Caller Authentication and Abuse Prevention

**Feature**: `specs/105-gateway-caller-auth` | **Phase**: 1 | **Date**: 2026-09-04

This document fixes the vocabulary the implementation uses. Nothing here is persisted to a member's
device or to a chain; every entity is either request-scoped, held in process memory, or read from
configuration. **No entity in this feature stores member business data**, which is what keeps the
gateway inside the bounded no-backend exception.

---

## 1. AssuranceTier

The central concept. Everything else is defined relative to it.

An ordered enumeration describing **what was actually proven about a caller**. Order matters: a route
declares a minimum, and a caller satisfies it by holding that tier or higher.

| Value | Ordinal | What it proves | Obtained from |
|---|---|---|---|
| `anonymous` | 0 | Nothing. The request arrived. | absence of any credential |
| `human` | 1 | A real browser on a real device, recently | a verified challenge token |
| `address` | 2 | Control of a specific account | a verified capability grant, signature only |
| `member` | 3 | That, **plus an active paid membership** | the same grant, plus a successful tier read |
| `app` | 4 | This exact signed application binary | device attestation (**not built** — see §8) |

### Why `address` and `member` are separate rungs

The existing verifier returns **403 `membership_required`** unless the account holds a live paid tier on
the reference chain. So "member-verified" in this codebase already means *"holds a paid membership"*,
not *"proved control of this address"* — and gating trading, broadcast or listing on it would stop any
member without a paid tier from trading at all. That is a severe regression this feature never intended.

Splitting the rung fixes it without weakening anything: **proof of control is what these routes actually
need.** A caller who signed a grant is stable, revocable, attributable and rate-limitable, which is
everything metering and accountability require. Whether they also bought a membership is a *product*
question that this feature must not silently answer.

`address` outranks `human` because it is strictly more accountable — a challenge token proves a browser
existed, an account proves who is answerable.

### Rules

- **The ladder is not a claim of app identity.** `human` and `member` say nothing about *which*
  application made the request. Only `app` does, and it is unreachable on the web. FR-005 binds every
  message, log field and metric label to this distinction.
- **Ordinals are for comparison only.** They are never serialised, never sent to a client, and never
  stored — a route asserts `tierOf(req) >= MEMBER`, and that is the entire use.
- **A tier is established per request**, from credentials presented on that request. There is no
  session object and no server-side session state.
- **Higher is not automatic.** A member-verified caller is `member`, not `app`. A caller presenting
  both a challenge token and a grant resolves to `member` (the higher), and both facts are recorded.

## 2. CallerIdentity

The resolved outcome of examining one request. Request-scoped; never persisted.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `tier` | AssuranceTier | the highest tier actually proven |
| `subject` | string \| null | the **non-rotatable** identifier metering keys on (§5). Account address at `address`/`member`; challenge-token digest at `human`; `null` at `anonymous` |
| `evidence` | Evidence[] | every credential examined and its outcome — for audit, never for authorisation |
| `verificationState` | `verified` \| `unverifiable` | **load-bearing**, see below |
| `reason` | string \| null | present only when a credential was rejected or unverifiable |

### `verificationState` is not a boolean in disguise

`unverifiable` means a dependency could not be reached — the membership source timed out, the
challenge service was unreachable. It is **categorically not** a failed verification, and the two must
never collapse into one falsy value. FR-009 and FR-017 turn on this: `unverifiable` yields a retryable
temporary failure, never a denial.

This is why the field is a string enumeration rather than `verified: boolean`. A boolean has one
falsy value and would force two very different outcomes to share it — which is exactly the bug the
requirement exists to prevent.

### Evidence

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `kind` | `challenge` \| `grant` \| `attestation` | which credential type |
| `outcome` | `accepted` \| `rejected` \| `unverifiable` \| `absent` | |
| `tierIfAccepted` | AssuranceTier | what this credential would grant |
| `detail` | string \| null | **never** contains credential material |

---

## 3. CredentialVerifier

The extension point FR-004 requires. A verifier examines one credential kind and returns Evidence.

```
verify(request) -> { kind, outcome, tierIfAccepted, subject?, detail? }
```

### Rules

- **Adding a tier means adding a verifier, never editing a route.** The attestation tier ships as a
  verifier registration and nothing else. This is the whole reason the shape exists.
- **A verifier never throws to deny.** A thrown error is indistinguishable from a bug; a verifier
  returns `rejected` for "this credential is not valid" and `unverifiable` for "I could not tell".
- **Verifiers are independent and order-free.** Resolution runs each and takes the maximum accepted
  tier. No verifier may depend on another having run.
- **A verifier that is not configured returns `absent`, not `rejected`.** An unconfigured challenge
  service must not deny every anonymous caller.

---

## 4. ProtectedRoute

Configuration, not runtime state. Declares what a route demands.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `pattern` | string | route path pattern |
| `minimumTier` | AssuranceTier | the floor |
| `upstream` | string \| null | which upstream credential this route spends, for §6 attribution |
| `class` | `read` \| `write` \| `sign` | drives defaults and the FR-007 audit |

### The declaration is the source of truth

There is exactly one table. The middleware, the operator display, the metering attribution and the
least-privilege tests all read it. A route absent from the table is a configuration error rather than
an implicitly public route — **silence is not permission**, matching the deny-by-default posture the
platform already applies to vault policy.

Initial assignment, from FR-007:

| Route class | Minimum | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Market, listing and perps **reads** | **`anonymous`** | FR-006 — reads never refuse for want of a tier |
| Keyed-access **issuance** | **`anonymous`** | FR-022 — tier shapes *what* is issued, never *whether* |
| Bitcoin **broadcast**, marketplace and venue **writes**, venue **order signing** | **`address`** | irreversible, or spends platform commercial standing — needs an answerable party, not a purchase |
| Health, status, build identity | `anonymous` | unchanged |

### A challenge is a metering upgrade, never an access gate

This is the correction that most improves the feature, and the first draft of this document got it
wrong — it put a `human` minimum on reads, which turns an unreachable challenge service into a
**non-retryable 403** on exactly the surfaces FR-006, FR-017 and US1 scenario 3 require to keep working.

Tier does not decide *whether* a read is served. It decides **how much**:

| Tier | Read access | Rate ceiling |
|---|---|---|
| `anonymous` | yes | low |
| `human` | yes | materially higher |
| `address` / `member` | yes | highest |

A challenge outage therefore costs throughput and never access, and a logged-out visitor needs no
challenge ceremony during boot before the first market fetch. **Reads never refuse for want of a tier;
they slow down.**

`member` appears in no row of the route table. It is a tier the ladder can express and that metering may
reward, and deliberately not a requirement this feature imposes anywhere.

---

## 5. UsageCounter

Consumption recorded against an identifier the caller cannot freely rotate.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `scope` | `{ tier, upstream }` | independent windows, per FR-012 |
| `subject` | string | from CallerIdentity.subject; falls back to a network identifier only at `anonymous` |
| `count` / `window` | number / duration | |

### Rules

- **The key is never caller-asserted.** This is the defect being repaired: an address supplied in a
  request path is a self-chosen name, and metering on it means metering on nothing.
- **Tiers do not share a window.** Exhausting the anonymous allowance must not deny an authenticated
  member — one window cannot serve two different promises.
- **Counters are operational state, not records.** They may be lost on restart. Nothing in this
  feature treats a counter as evidence of anything.

---

## 6. UpstreamCredential

Configuration describing a platform-held third-party credential.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | stable identifier, also the metric label (bounded set — FR-027) |
| `ceiling` | rate/spend cap | enforced **before** the upstream is called (FR-013) |
| `enabled` | boolean | disableable without redeploy (FR-014) |
| `rotationRunbook` | doc reference | FR-032 |

**The ceiling is checked before the call, not after.** A cap enforced on the response bounds nothing —
the spend has already happened. This is the difference between a budget and a receipt.

---

## 7–9. Keyed data access — moved to spec 106

`IssuedAccess`, `ProviderEndpoint` and `AccessIssuanceRecord` moved with the requirements they
served. One rule from them is worth keeping visible here, because it is a general principle this
feature relies on and not a detail of that provider:

**`unverifiable` does not always mean "retry".** Everywhere in *this* feature it does — failing
closed on an unreachable dependency would deny a legitimate member, so `auth_unverifiable` and
`membership_unreadable` are retryable and never denials. But at a check whose whole purpose is to
confirm that a credential about to be transmitted is *not* sufficient on its own, failing open
transmits an unprotected credential, so "could not tell" must be treated as "no".

The direction of failure is chosen per check, from what the failure would cost. It is not a
house style, and a future reader should not "fix" the inconsistency.

## What is deliberately absent

- **No session store.** Identity resolves per request from presented credentials.
- **No member profile, preference, or business data.** The gateway stays stateless with respect to
  members, which is the property the no-backend exception is bounded by.
- **No credential persistence.** Issued credentials are minted and forgotten; the audit record holds
  the decision, not the secret.
- **No credential minting of any kind.** Runtime issuance of keyed provider credentials is spec 106;
  this feature only ever *examines* credentials a caller already holds.
