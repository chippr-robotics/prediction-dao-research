# Tasks: Seamless multichain UX — chain-abstracted writes on a single EVM seam

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/110-multichain-write-seam/` (spec.md, plan.md) + measured
research in issue #1552.

**Organization**: Grouped by delivery phase; each phase is a sub-issue of #1552 and merges as its
own PR (or small PR series) with `Closes #<sub-issue>` in the body. `[P]` = parallelizable within
its phase. Counts marked *(re-measure)* are re-taken at phase start — they drift.

## Phase 0 — Free wins and the ratchet (#1591)

- [ ] T001 Re-measure the ethers import inventory over `frontend/src` (non-test): pure-util-only /
      read-path / signer-touching classes; record the file lists in the PR (192 at plan time).
- [ ] T002 Add ESLint `no-restricted-imports` for `ethers` scoped to `frontend/src`, allowlist
      seeded at the T001 inventory. The allowlist only ever shrinks; shrinking it is part of every
      later phase's definition of done.
- [ ] T003 [P] Codemod the pure-util-only files (~43) to viem equivalents (`formatUnits`,
      `parseUnits`, `getAddress`, `isAddress`, `keccak256`, `zeroAddress`, …); shrink the
      allowlist by the same set. Full suite, not scoped runs (spec 075 stale-import caveat).
- [ ] T004 [P] Add `viem` to `HOST_SHARED_MODULES` in `frontend/src/lib/miniapps/manifest.js` —
      additive, minor `hostApi` bump; update `specs/073-miniapp-platform/contracts/host-context.md`.
- [ ] T005 Gates: `npm run check:deps`, byte gates, full frontend suite; `deps:reinstall` only.

## Phase 1 — The read seam (#1592)

- [ ] T010 Pin current provider semantics with tests before converting: spec-069 endpoint
      precedence, header credential attachment, failover behavior, `useEndpointsRevision`
      reactivity (extend `src/test/network/` as needed).
- [ ] T011 Build `frontend/src/lib/chains/readContract.js`:
      `readContract(chainId, { address, abi, functionName, args })` on a viem `PublicClient` per
      chain, member-endpoint resolution via the one seam, `fallback` transport at quorum-1
      semantics, stable client identity per chain (mini-app `readProvider` caching precedent).
- [ ] T012 Convert the read-path files (~80, *(re-measure)*) onto `readContract`; delete the
      ethers `_lastFatalError` workaround in `frontend/src/utils/rpcProvider.js` rather than
      porting it. Shrink the allowlist per file converted.
- [ ] T013 Estate reads (`lib/chains/estate.js`, spec-089 reading constructors) keep three-state
      semantics byte-for-byte — assert no `?? 0` path appears in conversion.
- [ ] T014 Gates: full suite + both e2e tiers green; allowlist reflects every converted file.

## Phase 2 — The write seam (#1593) 🎯 the chain abstraction

**Capabilities first (each testable in isolation):**

- [ ] T020 [P] Sync `verifyMessage`/`recoverAddress` on `@noble/curves` in
      `frontend/src/lib/verify/` — signature stays synchronous, takes no client; spec 084 fixture
      suite (`src/test/fixtures/signedMessages.js`) passes unchanged.
- [ ] T021 [P] `lib/hardware/hardwareSigner.js` → viem `toAccount({ address, signMessage,
      signTransaction, signTypedData })`; recover-and-verify-before-broadcast behavior preserved.
- [ ] T022 [P] `lib/recovery/legacyKeys.js`: nonce management re-derived on viem's account
      `nonceManager` — port the reasoning ("a refused transaction never consumed its nonce"), with
      tests proving refusal/re-submit sequences.
- [ ] T023 [P] `lib/chain/revertError.js` → `decodeErrorResult` + `BaseError.walk()`; keep
      `useAdminTx`'s per-call `errorAbi` contract (#1267).

**The seam:**

- [ ] T024 Build `frontend/src/lib/chains/submitOn.js`: `submitOn(chainId, payload)` carrying the
      acting identity; rail resolution → passkey (`sendPasskeyBatch({ chainId })`, no switch) |
      intent (target chain's EIP-712 domain, no switch) | signer (the ONE switch-and-settle loop,
      constants decided once, refusal names both chains and signs nothing).
- [ ] T025 Generalize `lib/custody/writeRail.js#resolveWriteRail` out of custody; add
      reachability verification so availability is stated before the tap, never discovered at
      submit (`requireWriteRail` throwing form kept for callbacks).
- [ ] T026 Replace `submitAsActiveAccount`'s chain-blind personal branch with the seam (vault
      branch keeps spec-102 tap-time switching semantics through the same loop); retire the three
      settle-loop copies in `hooks/useEarnSend.js`, `hooks/useActiveAccount.js`,
      `hooks/useVaultDeployment.js`.
- [ ] T027 `lib/relay/useGaslessWrite.js` stops resolving signer/domain/verifier from the ambient
      chain — target chain in, domain out; no wallet switch on the intent rail.
- [ ] T028 Convert the signer-touching files (~65, *(re-measure)*) onto `submitOn`; empty the
      ethers allowlist for shipped `frontend/src` paths.
- [ ] T029 E2E per spec 094: on-chain coverage for cross-chain claim and intent-without-switch;
      no-chain coverage for refused-switch disclosure and before-tap rail unavailability. Flip the
      four `110-multichain-write-seam` matrix rows as each lands.

## Phase 3 — Ambient-chain ban (#1594)

- [ ] T030 Lint ban on `useChainId()` (wagmi) in `frontend/src`; wallet location reads
      `useAccount().chainId`; target chains come from actions. 27 call sites *(re-measure)* → 0.
- [ ] T031 Delete `hooks/useWalletChainId.js`; honest rendering for a wallet on a chain absent
      from the build (acceptance scenario 7) with a test.

## Phase 4 — Surfaces name their target (#1595)

- [ ] T040 Estate-wide wager/pool reads for action-bearing surfaces (`createEstateLedger` shape):
      `FriendMarketsContext` / `fetchFriendMarketsForUser` gain per-chain three-state readings;
      Claim/Refund/Resolve carry their wager's chain.
- [ ] T041 Retire the 26 `switchNetwork`/`switchChain` call sites across 14 member components
      *(re-measure)* — each becomes a declared target through `submitOn` or is deleted; no member
      surface renders a "Switch to <network>" control (operator console exempt, spec 071).
- [ ] T042 E2E: acceptance scenarios 1, 2, 6, 7 across the tiers; a11y scans on changed surfaces.

## Phase 5 — Packages, then services (#1596)

- [ ] T050 Migrate 3 first-party packages (21 files) to the viem host module; rebuild; re-record
      digests (`scripts/miniapps/record-build-digests.js` — accepted-bytes decision recorded in
      the PR); re-approve at new CIDs on Polygon 137 and Mordor 63 (resolve by slug, never id
      across cohorts).
- [ ] T051 Remove `ethers` from `HOST_SHARED_MODULES` + `host.readProvider` hands a viem-shaped
      client — hostApi 3 major; update `specs/073-miniapp-platform/contracts/host-context.md`.
- [ ] T052 Migrate `services/relay-gateway` (11 files) and `services/finops-exporter` (6) — or
      record the decision to keep them on ethers deliberately.
- [ ] T053 Final commit: remove `ethers` from root `overrides` and every `package.json`;
      `deps:reinstall`; all byte gates + `check:deps` green.

## Cross-phase invariants (checked in every phase's PR)

- `npm run deps:reinstall`, never `npm install` (npm/cli#4828).
- Full suite / real build for validation — scoped vitest runs cannot see stale imports.
- Ratchet allowlist shrinks monotonically; a PR that grows it is wrong by construction.
- Money-path changes carry on-chain e2e per spec 094; matrix rows move with the work.
- Writes stay single-chain atomic; operator console untouched; non-EVM ids refused at the seam.
