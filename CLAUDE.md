# FairWins / Prediction DAO — Agent Guide

FairWins is a peer-to-peer wager management layer: smart contracts that escrow
stakes and resolve wagers from external oracles (Polymarket, Chainlink, UMA),
plus a React frontend and a subgraph for indexing.

## Spec-driven development (Spec Kit)

This repo uses [Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) to add features in a
repeatable way. Use the `speckit-*` skills:

1. `/speckit-constitution` — review/update the project standards
2. `/speckit-specify` — capture *what* and *why* (no tech choices yet)
3. `/speckit-clarify` — de-risk ambiguities (optional, before planning)
4. `/speckit-plan` — design the implementation against the chosen stack
5. `/speckit-tasks` — break the plan into ordered, actionable tasks
6. `/speckit-analyze` — cross-check spec/plan/tasks consistency (optional)
7. `/speckit-implement` — execute the tasks

The binding standards live in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Every plan must
pass a constitution check; read it before planning or implementing. Per-feature
artifacts live under `specs/<feature>/`.

## Repository map

- `contracts/` — active Solidity (wagers, oracles, access, privacy). `mocks/` is
  test-only. `contracts-archive/` is reference-only; never import or deploy it.
- `test/` — Hardhat tests: unit (`*.test.js`), `integration/`, `fork/`, `oracles/`.
- `frontend/` — React + Vite app, tested with Vitest.
- `subgraph/` — The Graph indexing.
- `scripts/` — deploy, ops, and frontend-contract sync utilities.
- `deployments/` — recorded on-chain addresses (source of truth).

## Common commands

- `npm run compile` / `npm test` — compile and run the contract suite
- `npm run test:fork` / `npm run test:coverage` — fork tests / coverage
- `npm run test:frontend` — frontend tests
- `npm run frontend` — run the frontend dev server
- `npm run sync:frontend-contracts` — regenerate frontend contract artifacts

## Guardrails

- Security-first: contract changes follow checks-effects-interactions, pass
  Slither/Medusa, and get a security review (`.github/agents/`).
- Never commit secrets or private keys; admin keys use the floppy keystore flow.
- CI fails loudly — don't add `continue-on-error` to lint/test/build/security.
